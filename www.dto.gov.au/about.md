<h1>About us</h1>
  
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Every day, more Australians choose to interact with government on their mobiles, tablets and computers rather than face-to-face or over the phone.</p>
<p>That’s why the Digital Transformation Office (or DTO) has been created - to lead the government in transforming our services to improve your experience.</p>
<p>We’re working closely with individuals, businesses and industries as well as with Australian Government departments.</p>
<p>We’re identifying where improvements are most urgently needed, and re-designing these services from the ground up.</p>
<p>If you agree that dealing with the government should be (at least) as quick and easy as dealing with any other business, please <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/engage">get in touch</a> to see how you can work with us.</p>
<p>You can also keep up with us online though our <a href="/blog">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ausdto">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://govspace.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=18f172213d32ca205c7e524bd&amp;id=172d06cc83">mailing list</a>.</p>

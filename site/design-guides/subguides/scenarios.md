Scenarios
=========

Capturing how and why people use services

Scenarios are fictional stories that describe the specific activities a user undertakes. They describe the user experience by looking at activities rather than interactions. Scenarios are meant to simulate the experience of a user. They are often based on, or told from the perspective of a persona.

Using scenarios enables the team to focus on the current and desired future user experience, and what will be required to create and/or improve it.

Scenarios include a number of important elements about the user’s environment, these include:

-   user and usability goals
-   critical design features
-   business goals
-   context of use. 

Define users or characters
--------------------------

Using your user research, identify and explore the users you are designing for, consider the details of their lives; their job, regular activities and attitudes. You can base scenarios on personas and user pathways.

Create the scenario
-------------------

Identify key moments where users interact with your product or service, then translate them into scenes in a short text or a storyboard.

1.  Identify the motivator or trigger for the action
    -   What are the user’s expectations of the interaction?
    -   Why is the user doing something now?
    -   What will make the interaction successful?
    -   What is the environment they’re doing the action in?

2.  Describe the interaction
    -   What are the critical steps and activities the user has to do?
    -   What happens between the critical steps?
    -   How does the user feel throughout the process?
    -   What thoughts are running through their mind as they complete the tasks?

3.  End with the result
    -   What happens as a result of this interaction?
    -   What made it a success?
    -   Did the outcome match their initial expectations?

Test and iterate
----------------

Test the scenario with users and check for gaps. To investigate the full scope of user interactions, you may need to construct three or four scenarios around the needs of different users and improve them with each iteration.

Share your scenarios
--------------------

Share the scenarios with stakeholders. Scenarios are a great way to communicate current state problems, or the desired design in a non-technical way. Include them in your high level design so that they can be referred to throughout the service design process.

The ATO Program Blueprint provides contains an example scenario of [a new father returning to work part-time](http://reinventing.ato.gov.au/your-future-experience/individuals/new-father-returning-work).

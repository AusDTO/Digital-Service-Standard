High level design
=================

A blueprint that captures and communicates product, service or improvement design

A high level design (often referred to as a blueprint) is a living document that evolves with the project through the [service design process](../../node/service_design_process.md). At a minimum it describes the intent of the change or new product or service. It highlights the impacts on users’ experience, stakeholders, processes, technology, policy and law. It is about generating and refining ideas to design solutions that are integrated, holistic and balanced.

A good high level design will lead to services that are:

-   desirable: useful, usable and contemporary
-   possible: consistent with existing legislation and achievable within the available capability viable: aligned with strategic direction and cost effective.

The high level design is developed by capturing outcomes throughout the [service design process](../../node/service_design_process.md). It provides the major input into project plans and the detailed design documents that ensure the service delivers on the intent.

A good high level design will ensure [the team](../../the_team.md) is aware of:

-   users’ end-to-end experience
-   key existing products and services
-   required capability to build, deliver and administer the solution
-   assistance required so government, sponsors and other stakeholders can make informed decisions
-   design issues or gaps
-   opportunities to use [common platforms](../../node/government_as_a_platform.md).

High level design users
-----------------------

A high level design is usually put together by a single creator (or creator team) to maintain a cohesive voice, but is contributed to by [the team](../../the_team.md) working through the [service design process](../../node/service_design_process.md).

All team members use the document to capture their design as they evolve through the stages of their project. They may also use it to communicate with stakeholders and users to explain their design. It’s important to identify all of the areas/agencies impacted by the change and who should provide input.

An executive team may use the document to make informed decision. A technical build / detailed design team may use the document to support business specifications and to understand what the desired user experience is.

Selecting content
-----------------

The document should contain different levels of detail depending on the audience and the types of changes. For a change outlining the strategic direction of an organisation, the information may be quite high level and visionary. For a change to the design of a new app, the content may go down to a more technical level.

At a minimum, the high level design should answer the following questions:

-   What is the intent?
-   What is the current situation and why does it need to change?
-   The [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) (in the ABCD model)
-   Where are we now?
-   Where do we want to be?
-   How will we get there?
-   What will need to be done?
-   Who are the users? [User research](../../node/user_research.md) will help to inform who your user groups; capturing this information in [personas](../../node/personas.md)and empathy maps can help to bring the data to life.
-   How will the users interact with the change? This may be captured through [user pathways](../../node/user_pathways.md), [scenarios](../../node/scenarios.md)and user journey maps.
-   What options are there?
-   What are the culture, process, products, workforce, policy, law and systems that need to be modified or developed? It’s good to map these against your [user pathway](../../node/user_pathways.md) or business process maps to ensure that each step has been considered.
-   How will the new products and services fit together and fit within the existing system? This can be explored in [user pathways](../../node/user_pathways.md) and business process maps or diagrams.
-   What are the design issues, risks and assumptions?
-   Are there any related programs, projects or initiatives?
-   How will success of the change be measured, when should it be reviewed

Developing the document
-----------------------

You can support the ongoing development of the high level design through the composition of [the team](../../the_team.md) and the choices of regular design activities.

The team should be a small multidisciplinary group, with members communicating and consulting out to their area of expertise when required. The whole team should share responsibility for ensuring the intent is achieved. If all of the team provide up-front input in to the design it will minimise rework later on.

The team should work collaboratively by running [workshops](../../node/workshops.md)with different areas or teams and source input from various disciplines on a design as required. They should share expertise and perspectives to achieve a shared understanding of the problem or idea and the products and services required to support the whole design.

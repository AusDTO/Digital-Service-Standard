Comment: 

Hi, I am interested to see the nature of job roles being advertised for DTO, - helps to understand DTO will be hands on involved in development of digital services for the Australian community not just an overseeing role across federal departments. Is the model intended to be similar to Apple for example, where companies can develop 'Apps', but they must satisfy Apple's quality/security/UI standards, - and Apple put these through a stringent verification process prior to allowing new/changed Apps to be made available from their online store. In this situation are the DTO going to define the standards utilising feedback from user centred design, and develop services themselves where feasible to do so.
 Then will DTO also play a similar role to Apple, with government departments similar to companies building apps/services, - the departments have to verify for themselves first that they meet the minimum critieria to be made available through MyGov, and DTO do a verification process as a final check prior to allowing the new/amended service to be made available through MyGov, - to ensure quality, security, volume and UI standards are compliant. This would be a good way of ensuring high standards are maintained, and consistency in user experience across whole of government services.

Is there a date when the application process closes, or does it just stay open until you have found the right people?

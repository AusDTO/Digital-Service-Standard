DTO Communications

We are proud to be the lead agency sponsor for GovHack 2015, Australia’s biggest national open data competition. This year GovHack, which runs from 3-5 July, has over 2000 participants across 31 locations in Australia and New Zealand.

We are here to transform government for the digital age, making services better, simpler and faster. GovHack brings people together with enormous technical and creative capacity to innovate and create. Participants will use government data and Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to create apps, analysis, data visualisation and 3D printing – all over a period of just 46 hours!

Put simply, govhackers have one goal: to build great things with government data. This clearly fits with our goals here at the DTO. To support GovHack’s work, we are sponsoring two prizes in 2015, as well as providing mentors for the competition and supporting the Red Carpet Awards in September. We look forward to a future of ongoing collaboration with this community.

For the competition, we have developed a proof of concept [register of government services](../news-media/blog/making-government-discoverable.html). This will help people effectively move from finding information to accessing services. Some agencies have developed service catalogues that are of great value to the public, but to date there is no single or complete view of services across the federal government.

 

For more information on GovHack, see the [GovHack website](https://www.govhack.org/) and stay tuned in September for more about our prize winners!

Have you noticed things are different around here?

We’ve tidied up the layout of our site, used simple icons for easy navigation and made it more compatible with Internet Explorer. 

We’ve also added links to our [Digital Service Design Guides](../digital_service_design_guide.md) – a growing collection of information to help Australian Government agencies meet the [Digital Service Standard](../standard/digital_service_standard.md).

**But we know it can be better.**

We’re not perfect. Not yet. We expect to keep changing our site to better serve the needs of our users. So please, tell us what you think so we can keep transforming our site for the better. Leave your comments here on the blog, or [send us your feedback](mailto:Communications@dto.gov.au).

Hi Brant,

Would you give this one some thought. The one thing which we all want to do here is make things user-centric. So another new (dto.departmental) website continues the problem of a user attempting to stay abreast of what happening across three levels of gov. e.g. with the new NSW "tell us once" service, a user with have to tell two govs twice. [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/news/new-online-account-helps-nsw-citizen...](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/news/new-online-account-helps-nsw-citizens-tell-us-once)

Could we consider using the my.gov.au site as the place where the WOG consultations, and their records, will be run and kept? Ideally, a user would be able to use their my.gov.au account to log into the latest conversations about similar initiatives from all 3 tiers of gov.

And people inside gov might be encouraged to share the same space and apps. [http://www.vanguard.business.gov.au/ourservices/Pages/Federated-Authenti...](http://www.vanguard.business.gov.au/ourservices/Pages/Federated-Authentication-Service-%28FAS%29.aspx)

We know that we want to share the learning, openly, with people in Aus and overseas. [https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/29/same-but-different-a-common-internati...](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/29/same-but-different-a-common-international-approach-to-digital-government/)

But govs don't seem to comprehend that the (authentication and apps) tools they could be sharing between people in other govs, and their citizens, will require the same (federated) authentication model, which many unis already use, globally.

We also know that we want to encourage the use of a common authentication platform, and personalized services, which for all citizens, will revolve around mygov.au. So would you consider running any engagement/consultations, and WOG updates at the mygov.au site.

If we do want to be trans-formative here we really do need to try and different approach to "just another website". Hopefully, we can separate the emotion of political debate from the engineering challenges. “The key element is that the numbering people is a policy question. Transparency is a policy question. Connectivity is a policy question. After those questions are answered, the rest is engineering.” [http://www.themandarin.com.au/31637-australia-false-understanding-privac...](http://www.themandarin.com.au/31637-australia-false-understanding-privacy-says-estonia-cio/)

It's good that you're "growing a collection of information to help Australian Government agencies meet the Digital Service Standard". But information won't encourage agencies and departments to collaborate. For that to happen we need to give them a place to share a user-centric focus.

Hi there,

I agree with Simonfj. As a UX designer in one of the big gov agency, most of my colleagues here are thinking 'yeah, great, but how does this apply to us?'. It's just yet another website for now and the challenge is to give it a central position and focus.

Also on a very practical level, the website's layout is pretty good, but I find the icons you've chosen way too complicated.

Cheers,

New icons on the way with the next iteration coming soon!

As the keeper of many departmental websites previously, I understand your thinking. We'll be out and about soon to hear from you how this applies and share our thoughts.

We thought long and hard about adding another website to the already large number of websites but we needed a voice. We'll be the first to give up our own unique website as a more connected vision materialises. Please check out our recent blogs for some of the points you have raised and stay tuned for the others. All good points, thanks for your engagement.

New site looks much better... well done to the team working on this! Good to see what happens when you put a few sprinkles on the vanilla build of GovCMS. Looking forward to seeing what else you can make it do! :-)

I agree with Darren. It looks a lot better. Funny that he likes sprinkles on the vanilla layout. I was hoping for a chocolate flake. Either way, it does look better.

Good work, just a heads up the LinkedIn icon in the footer is displaying incorrectly in IE.

Thanks for the heads up Tom. We'll investigate.

User zoom seems to be disabled on mobile, which is a problem for accessibility. People with poor vision need to be able to zoom in. WCAG specifies the zoom factor that must be achievable without needing to use the device's dedicated accessibility features.

Thanks Andrew, good pickup. Fix for this will be in our next release.

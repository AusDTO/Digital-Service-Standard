It’s useful to examine the way people find and use government websites, as this can reflect underlying needs and preferences. And the more we understand about those underlying needs, the better job we can do of designing content and services to meet them.

Most people start with Google, so we thought we'd start there too. Usage analytics tell us where people go and what they do online, but the words and phrases people use in Google tell us something more - we get a glimpse of what they already know, what context they have, and their starting intent and expectations.

We engaged Donna Spencer from MaadMob to help us analyse around 13,000 search terms from a bunch of Australian Government websites, and quite quickly some patterns of behaviour started to emerge.

### Direct entry:

A person uses Google to locate a specific website or agency, including:

-   Entering a URL (or approximation of a URL) - "ato.gov"
-   Entering a version of an agency name - "ato Australia" "tax office"
-   Asking for contact details - "contact medicare" "immigration office Melbourne"

### Known item search:

A person knows what they are looking for, including:

-   Using a specific term that gives a specific answer - "auskey registration" "visa subclass 489"
-   Using a specific term and defining a specific format - "2014 tax calculator" "medicare claim form"
-   Using a general term that has a specific answer - "when is spring in Australia" "who can certify documents" "what electorate am I in"
-   Starting a transaction - "ABN lookup" "my gov au login"
-   Checking on a transaction - "track my tax return" "check my visa status"

### Exploratory behaviours:

A person only has a rough idea of what they are after, and may not have the terminology to describe it or know who might have the answer, including:

-   Using a specific term that has a broad answer - "age pension" "self managed super fund" "justice of the peace"
-   Using a broad term that has a broad answer - "Australian visa" "medicare levy" "business plan"

### How can we use this information?

We will use the information to design better services that match these behaviours.  So we’re working on:

1. Better search engine optimisation – global search engines (like Google or Bing) do a pretty good job of helping people find what they need, but we need to optimise our content to make sure we return the right result for common behaviours, and accommodate the language people naturally use, variants, misspellings and so forth.

2. Better interaction pathways, for example:

-   Direct specific queries to specific answers, and broad queries to broader information that allows users to understand context and drill down further.
-   Direct contact requests to an appropriate contact page, with the right context. For example “contact Agency X” should go to that agency’s contact page, “contact service X” should go to a contact for the service if it exists.
-   Include explanations of how people can check on the progress of transactions and advice about processes and timelines. Make these explanations easy to find without having to login, even if the actual progress check requires a login.

3. Content targeted around user behaviours, for example:

-   Creating content around common queries – if everyone is asking a particular question, we should have a whole-of-government answer.
-   Using whole-of-government sites to answer common general queries that cross multiple agencies . This saves people from navigating across multiple sites and having to digest multiple agency-specific answers.
-   Using whole-of-government entry points to provide topic and life event overviews for people searching broad term

It also draws us to some other gaps and opportunities– one that comes to mind is how we might be able to use smarter search technologies or virtual assistant style technology to help match natural language queries to the right information, or help people refine down broad queries. We plan to design and test some of our work against these behaviours over the next few months and see what the impact is.

What do you think? Do you recognise these behaviours in yourself or in the users you provide digital services to? Do you have ideas about how to design for these behaviours?

This is all good stuff - understanding behaviours is fundamental to improving digital interaction. I am old enough to remember when customer research was undertaken to improve products such as publications (Yes Vanessa, these were called booklets) and other customer facing services. I think an equal challenge facing us in transforming digital services is understanding the behaviours of departments who ignore the research or don't bother to do any (no time, too much money, no plausible deniability etc). How do we get inside their heads - or hearts and wallets - to ensure that valuable research such as that above is actually acted upon and organisational mindsets are changed. Bookshelves are full of client research, ignored and collecting dust. Let's not have hard drives full of the same please.

Hi Peter, ... and agreed! I hope the DTO and other agencies can demonstrate the sort of benefits that come from paying attention to user research. I also think doing user research early helps, before people are too wedded to an approach. Thanks for your comment.

That's a good sum up Vanessa. One of the many challenges I faced when managing large information systems in the past is the sheer volume of content and analytical data. One creating targeted content I see a way of doing that is to feed the common queries where there is a content gap into an algorithm and let it create the targeted content. Open source solutions such as GovCMS created excellent opportunities for the government to develop and deploy this kind of solutions and with DTO taking a lead I can see the quality of the government's digital service is only going to be better.

Good article that covers off the fundamentals, nice. Google, Bing, Yahoo and others are all changing their search algorithms to become more human-like and there's no point in trying to out-fox these as it will all change in 12 months anyway. Focus on what the user will truly be searching for, don't assume they'll be following your funnel and cater for different user entry points, capabilities and behaviour.

Peter makes a good point, half the challenge is going to be how to pass this knowledge/system on to departments in a manageable format for various staff. Accessibility is seen as a nightmare because there is no 'tick the box' compliance for harried staff.

Or, will there be a central service/area/department that deals with the front-end and connects to each department's aligned backend?

None of the above is new, it is all good stuff.
 What is lacking is an understanding within government of the power of these analytics, the willingness to utilise what is being learnt and then the courage to modify sites to improve the user experience.
 Good luck to DTO in generating a change, I sincerely wish you well.

What is new is that, back in the 1990s when we set up the first australia.gov.au search engine, there were no analytics available from WebCrawler or AltaVista or Yahoo to compare with the search traffic we could analyse coming into us. Now there is the potential to compare the analytics from Google with the data that should come from the current australia.gov.au site (and the state and territory searches), and start to build a pattern of how many people actually use the intermediary search engines, and how well they understand what is a state or federal service.
 Failed search terms are always more interesting than successful ones - they help you identify the things people assume the Australian Government runs, when in fact they are state or local government issues.

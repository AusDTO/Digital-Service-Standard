<p>Digital Mail Team</p>

<p>Today we’re excited to share with you our plans for transforming the way government agencies communicate with Australians. The Government is transforming how it transacts online and expanding and improving the myGov digital mail service is an important part of this process.</p>

<p>Each year, government agencies send hundreds of millions of letters and statements to Australians, and more and more of these letters are being sent digitally. In the past 12 or so months, more than 45 million letters have been sent by the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support to people using myGov.</p>

<p>Over the coming 2-3 years an increasing number of agencies will use myGov to deliver messages, letters and statements to Australians. This will make it much easier for Australians to get all their messages from government in one secure inbox.</p>

<p>On top of that, the messages will contain links to help people navigate to services and seamlessly complete digital transactions, from start to finish. This will save thousands of Australians time, money, and frustration. It will also be better for the environment, and people will be able to have their digital mail forwarded to accredited third-party mail providers.</p>

<p>But you might ask, “why not send messages via email?” The problem is that many government messages contain sensitive personal information about tax matters, welfare payments or health issues, and email is not a safe way of sending this type of information.</p>

<p><strong>Business</strong></p>

<p>We will also be expanding digital mail for businesses through a new digital account set for release in 2016. This will mean all Australian businesses will be able to get their messages from government in one place and then seamlessly complete digital transactions. This will be a game changer in the way business transacts with government, saving time and frustration.</p>

<p>How will someone know if there is Gov Mail for them? Assume there will be some push notification?</p>

<p>Are there any policies around the appropriate use of myGov mail by agencies? The only message I’ve gotten was some bulk mail from the ATO saying they were on myGov. It took a lot longer to login to a secure digital mailbox than to just read an email or open an envelope.</p>

<p>Maybe DTO should consider using the Australia Post MyPost solution? Australia Post carries all the government’s letter traffic now, so you already trust it - Aust Post is one of Australia’s most trusted brands. Their MyPost portal exists and works now, its easy to interface to, it claims to be secure (easily tested) and the government 100% owns Aust Post so you would be generating revenue for yourself! It might be a better option than spending a substantial sum building another digital mailbox solution, which may confuse the public. After all, I only have one letterbox at home, not one for government letters and one for everything else.</p>

<p>The Auspost website is pretty slick, I don’t know how this differs ? why would I want to login to the MyGov site and if I do need/have too they need to seriously work on the interface so ugly.</p>

<p>There needs to be an API for this to allow businesses to develop integration solutions. Requiring someone from a business to manually log in and check a mailbox periodically (in addition to their normal email) increases cost. Government should be developing solutions that allow notifications to be handled by automated systems.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, thanks for your feedback.</p>

<p> As with the current myGov inbox solution, people can choose to get an SMS or email when they receive a message in their myGov account. We are also going to be working with agencies and the community to make sure there is a standard approach to digital mail.</p>

<p> The DTO’s preference is to make APIs available. However, digital mail is designed so that senders and receivers can be sure their messages are delivered securely between authenticated parties. To ensure this, companies will be required to comply with high standards before they can become digital mail providers, and APIs will not be openly available for digital mail.</p>

<p>In terms of Australia Post’s MyPost service, people have been able to have their mail forwarded from their myGov account to their MyPost for some 12 months. We’ve chosen to work with third party digital mail providers like Australia Post because we think it is important that people have a choice of services, and we will be seeking to partner with other providers in the future. But we will also continue providing mail through myGov because many users prefer not to set up a separate digital mail service, and because myGov gives them the ability to undertake other transactions while logged in to their myGov account.</p>

<p>Sounds like a great initiative. Anything that saves me time (while reducing the governments environmental impact) is a winner in my eyes.</p>

<p>The delivery mechanism is not that important as long as the format is an open format like Open Document Format ODF an international standard which is not proprietary such as the currently used format PDF</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could securely access public services without needing to bring along a dozen forms of ID every time you did? </p>

<p>We want to deliver a way for citizens and businesses to transact with public services simply and securely.</p>

<p>The solution isn’t simple, but we’re committed to developing a Trusted Digital Identity Framework. And we want the Australian community to help us get there.</p>

<p>To start, we’re convening a roundtable – featuring leaders from the consumer, IT, identity policy, security, government, and business sectors.</p>

<p>Next, we’re organising an ‘identity policy workshop’ to start forging the Framework. </p>

<p>More details coming soon.</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Having worked on developing solutions for several federal government “digital identity” proposals, which never turned into projects mostly I think because of timid politicians, I am sceptical that this will idea will fare any better. Having said that, I think that our common law legal system is part of the difficulty for a project like this, because unlike Roman law countries, which have had national citizen (and non-citizen) identity systems in place for centuries (yes, centuries) and where the population is totally comfortable registering with the police each time they change address, etc., our legal system has no concept of an “Identity” document, except when imposed in wartime. I cannot see the legal profession supporting a significant change to our laws to introduce this concept - I imagine that the ramifications would be significant (e.g. for criminal law), if not enormous. Furthermore, having spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to determine someone’s “identity” in the first place - which is often much harder than it looks - the next hurdle is when upwards of 20 million people have to go through the process of “proving” who they are, seemingly just to make it easier to do business occasionally with a government department. However, anything less than such a rigorous process of establishing everyone’s “identity”, which by the way is the necessary foundation for any “digital identity”, would render unreliable the “secure public access” that you are seeking. For a practical example of these difficulties, ask the Defence Department about a project called “e-Defence” (aka JP2054 I think) which in the early 2000s aimed to replace its ageing military messaging system with an e-mail like alternative. It was (and still is afaik) suspended due to the lack of a secure “Defence identity” for every user (only 90,000 or so). Nevertheless, I shall watch this matter with interest. Kind regards,</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Around 1999-2000 I worked with an international consortium of banks from UK, Europe and USA to develop a common legally binding digital signature. The program involved the technology development, the business product development e.g. international payments for consignment of goods, and the legal framework. We successfully lobbied the European parliament to extend signature laws to apply for appropriately secure (PKI Based) digital signatures accepted by the financial institutions. Australian laws can equally be extended I am sure.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments about some of the challenges and potential opportunities for the DTO around digital identity. Apologies for the slow reply.</p>

<p>The aim of our first blog is to let the community know that the DTO is talking about digital identity with leaders across a number of industry sectors and will shortly start a conversation with the broader community, too.</p>

<p>We want to encourage a constructive discussion amongst users of government services about how they want to interact, what their pain points are in the process (in particular around identification and authentication) and what government needs to do to make it easier for users to interact. </p>

<p>Our vision is one in which users have a choice in the method and manner in which they interact with government.  We appreciate your thoughts on how we can make this happen.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Shannon</p>

<p>Dear DTO Communications, (Funny ID for an author :)</p>

<p>I’ll just point out this one of so many conversations going on this space. <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/the-data-trust-blog/2014/11/identity-assurance-and-the-sha.html">http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/the-data-trust-blog/2014/11/identity…</a> The UK’s CW Data trust blog is one of quite a few that gives a nice summary of the local (National) conversations.</p>

<p>It might be more useful if you used the idea of building “trust fabrics” rather than a citizen’s ID. I hate the terminology but it is the one that network manager’s use in encouraging the sharing (as opposed to the delivery) economy.</p>

<p>It would be useful if the DTO would like to point at any libraries like this one. <a href="http://oixuk.org/?page_id=444">http://oixuk.org/?page_id=444</a> Always good to see the latest “proof of concept” reports.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ll point at these two <a href="http://wayf.dk/en">http://wayf.dk/en</a>
 <a href="https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/wayf#what_is_ecas">https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/wayf#what_is_ecas</a></p>

<p>The concept of one (public) institution sharing accepting credentials/attributes from others is, it seems, the main question here; not which institution issues an ID to every citizen. Question for all of them is, “Where are You (the user) From?”</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Hi Simonfj</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment and the links to some interesting websites.</p>

<p>My apologies for the delay in responding.</p>

<p>As you say there are a lot of conversations in the identity space backed up by activity in a number of countries.</p>

<p>Of particular interest to us here in the DTO are the UK IDA Program (the Government Digital Service ID Assurance Blog <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/">https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/</a> contains valuable information about the UK.Gov Verify program) and the US National Strategy for Trusted identities in Cyberspace (<a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/">http://www.nist.gov/nstic/</a>) as both initiatives rely on the involvement of private sector identity service providers working in what amounts to a federated identity system.</p>

<p>The focus in the DTO is the user.  This focus is central to the Digital Service Standard and associated Design Guide (check out <a href="its_here_the_digital_service_design_guides_have_arrived_in_alpha.md">https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/it-s-here-digital-service-design-guides-have-arrived-alpha</a>)</p>

<p>In this regard the essence of the trust framework will be to provide people with a choice of how and with whom to establish their identity and to give them the ability to reuse that identity across government.  So its not a question of which organisation issues a credential - that is the choice of the individual.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Shannon</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Thanks Shannon,</p>

<p>I appreciate what you’re saying. And thanks for the pointers to your English-speaking peers in the UK and US. You see I have too much to say there as well (since the GDS &amp; NSTIC started). e.g. <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/30/gov-uk-verify-how-we-use-our-social-media-channels/">https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/30/gov-uk-verify-how-we-us…</a> As you say, we want an ID that gives us the “ability to reuse that identity across government”.</p>

<p>I’d say “governmentS”. Presently, we can point to the (e.g) EU, and the approach they use to share access to Information and Communication systems across their silos. <a href="https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/wayf">https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/wayf</a> The same approach has been taken by tens of thousands of unis across the world. <a href="https://refeds.org/federations/federations-map">https://refeds.org/federations/federations-map</a></p>

<p>In this regard, I’m just pointing to the fact that only existing orgs can issue a particular credential/attribute (or “permission” as they say in the UK). e.g. It’s unlikely, that the State orgs, like NSW’s RTA, will be giving up the right to issue driver’s licences any time soon. The most interesting development here is whether users (who in the non-English world are known as “citizens”) will choose private, or public, orgs as their most-trusted in establishing their identity.</p>

<p>As a poser. I wonder what might happen if your Department (of Communications) were to enable their “users” with an identity which could be used across the Portfolio Agencies = ABC, SBS, NBN, Australia Post, AMCA, DTO. It would certainly influence other Department’s network managers and users to share/co-design resources rather than duplicating them.</p>

<p>It would also illustrate the point that, at present, individuals inside, and outside, government departments have NO choice. Access always comes down to “Where You Are From?” I’m sure there’s enough trust and goodwill to change all that now.</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Thanks to both comments from John and Simonfj both great reads.
 From what I am reading (as a novice to these discussions) what seems to be called for is a (w)hole of gov security. Is it possible to emulate the already documented Gov.UK series of security comments on issues of their security? Particularly the points made on 2.4 Security Policy Framework. This highlights 2.4 ‘culture and awareness’ and the ‘training which encourages personal responsibility and good security behaviour’ as I think these could be the major stumbling block for most of us ‘citizens’</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Keep in mind in your discussions that a digital ID doesn’t need to be issued or authorised by the Australian government. There’s no reason that people couldn’t use, for example, a bank ID, credit card ID, driver’s license (from state govs), Frequent Flier card, or some other form of ID as their universal digital ID.</p>

<p>Websites are not secured through government-issued credentials - SSL certificates are issued by private organisations - and I’ve not seen evidence that government is better or more efficient at identity management than organisations with an explicit interest in correctly identifying individuals due to both profit and legislative reasons.</p>

<p>Given the history of government ID cards in Australia, with the Australia card, it’d be far easier (politically and technically), faster and potentially cheaper to integrate with existing ID services than build another one.</p>

<p>While doing this, Australia also needs a serious review of our privacy framework to enforce reporting and consequences for mass privacy breaches. Currently if my ID is compromised via a US (government or corporate) service I get full information fairly quickly (not as quick as should be), but if my ID is compromised here in Australia, there’s no requirement for the company or agency to actually tell me. That’s a critical issue.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Craig</p>

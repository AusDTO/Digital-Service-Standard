<h1 id="workshops">Workshops</h1>

<p>Intensive collaboration to generate ideas, design, and solve problems</p>

<p>Solving complex problems usually requires input from multiple experts with diverse experience. Best practice for building user-centred services requires us to consult with key players to better shape our understanding and find appropriate solutions to issues. Running workshops is one way of bringing many experts together to cement ideas and find ways to go forward.</p>

<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>

<p>Workshops need to be well planned to ensure they are useful. An ideal workshop size is 8-15 people. Any more than that and it becomes difficult to ensure all voices are heard. A badly organised and run workshop will not give participants the confidence they need to comfortably and openly participate.</p>

<h2 id="define-your-intent">Define your intent</h2>

<p>Provide participants with information upfront rather than leaving it to the last minute. Have a clear intent or goal and ensure participants know what it is that they are trying to achieve in the workshop. Communicate goals early, as well as the reason you’ve asked each participant to attend. This will get you significantly better responses to your invitations.</p>

<h2 id="invite-the-right-people">Invite the right people</h2>

<p>Do your research and make sure the <a href="../../the_team.md">right people</a> are in the room. They should be people who are experts in the content, but also have the right level of authority to make the decisions that you require. Also make sure you’ve got the right representatives to actually solve problems and propose solutions.</p>

<h2 id="take-regular-breaks">Take regular breaks</h2>

<p>Workshops can be a hard slog. Working endlessly can limit creativity, be tiring and agitating. Schedule regular breaks and ensure there is water and snacks to keep everyone going. Be careful with breaks though; it’s disruptive to allow participants to step out for calls or other meetings.</p>

<h2 id="ensure-everyone-has-a-go">Ensure everyone has a go</h2>

<p>Avoid letting a small group of people dominate the conversation or workshop activities. Make sure your facilitator moderates strong voices and ensures other participants also have an opportunity to voice their opinions and actively contribute to the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="document-outcomes-as-you-go">Document outcomes as you go</h2>

<p>Conversations can often be misinterpreted. Capturing key information on a whiteboard or somewhere visible will ensure that workshop participants all have a clear understanding of the agreements (or disagreements) that have been reached. Where decisions affect the group the facilitator should always confirm that what they have captured is correct.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-facilitator">Choosing the right facilitator</h2>

<p>A facilitator is someone who leads the workshop participants through the process. Usually they’re responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that the session runs to time</li>
  <li>ensuring each participant has an equal chance to participate and voice opinions</li>
  <li>asking questions and probing deeper into issues</li>
  <li>using different thinking tools to lead the group towards the right outcomes</li>
  <li>adapting the workshop agenda (where required) in response to participant feedback and experience</li>
  <li>capturing agreed outcomes or issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>A facilitator may or may not be the same person who organised or scheduled the workshop, set the agenda and sent the invites to participants.</p>

<p>You can facilitate yourself if you’ve got limited workshop outcomes and the group you’re working with are easily engaged. However, if you’re a subject matter expert, or representing a specific view (that is, the project team), it is better to get another person to facilitate. It’s difficult to drive a conversation and contribute to it at the same time!</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to get a professional facilitator if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a lot of content to get through - a facilitator will keep the workshop on time and guide the conversation</li>
  <li>you’re unsure of how to achieve the outcomes you need - a facilitator can help you with the right tools and techniques</li>
  <li>the topic is controversial - a facilitator is an impartial moderator</li>
  <li>there are participants who will likely dominate the conversation - a facilitator will ensure everyone gets a say.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dont-be-misled">Don’t be misled</h2>

<p>Common misconceptions about workshops include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A workshop is just a meeting</strong>: the word ‘workshop’ has progressively replaced ‘meeting’, but they are fundamentally different. A workshop should be a hands-on event, with all the subject matter experts and decision makers in the room. A workshop will also generally use a series of thinking tools to get participants in the right frame of mind to solve problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Workshops are too long</strong>: a workshop can be any length of time. It just needs to be appropriate to cover the topics. Think carefully about how much time you allocate to each session. You may need a series of workshops if you need information from one session or topic to progress with others.</li>
  <li><strong>You need to plan workshops weeks in advance</strong>: you only require enough time to work out clear outcomes, for the planner and participants to prepare, and to find a meeting place and time for the right people to attend.</li>
</ul>

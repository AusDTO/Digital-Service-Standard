<p>How to use analytics to support service design</p>

<p>Understanding how users discover and interact with information is a key step in making government services easier to find and use. Through continuously assessing and analysing service performance we can promote ongoing improvements and support increased use of digital and self-service channels.</p>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>Analytics play an important role in every phase of the <a href="../../node/service_design_process.md">service design process</a>, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discovery and Define: understand user pathways and interactions with existing or like services.</li>
  <li>Create and Iterate: identify and remove user pain points.</li>
  <li>Deliver, Evaluate and Improve: plan for enhancements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analytics also help organisations to identify appropriate times to <a href="../../node/service_design_process.md#retire">retire services</a><a href="../../node/service_design_process.md#retire"> </a>due to inactivity or unsuccessful adoption.</p>

<p>There is comprehensive guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/analytics_tools.md">using analytics tools</a> in the UK Government Service Design Manual. You can also <a href="../../engage.md">contact the Digital Transformation Office</a> (DTO) for assistance when assessing analytics tools.</p>

<p>A whole-of-government approach to analytics will help us <a href="../../news-media/blog/building-better-services-analytics.html">build better services</a>[](../../news-media/blog/building-better-services-analytics.html)and improve the total experience of dealing with government. Contact your agency’s <a href="../../node/digital_transformation_coordinators.md">Digital Transformation Coordinator</a>[](https://www.dto.gov.au/digital-transformation-plan/digital-transformation-coordinators)for details on how to participate in the current trial.</p>

<h3 id="assess-analytics-tools">Assess analytics tools</h3>

<p>There are numerous analytics tools in the market place which deliver slightly different functions. Sometimes there are many tools with adequate functionality for the task at hand. The best choice are the tools that analysts are most familiar with, or those that are currently best integrated within your environment in other ways. Remember choices about analytics tool are not ‘set and forget’. Even the best choice now will inevitably be replaced with something better in the future.</p>

<p>Using a combination of tools will assist in developing a holistic picture of user interactions with digital services. You should include the following items in your decision making.</p>

<h4 id="required-data">Required data</h4>

<p>The data you need will depend on your business. Be aware that not all systems collect all of the data you might want, or display it in a way that your department may wish to use. For example, some tools present reports by page titles rather than URLs.</p>

<p>You should identify whether you need to collect data items such as location, devices, browsers, operating systems, pathways, natural and onsite search terms. You should also know whether you need the data to be accurate or whether an estimation will suffice.</p>

<h4 id="use-of-data">Use of data</h4>

<p>Consider how you will report to others about the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will you report by site structure or by the pages they own?</li>
  <li>Who will enact changes to content as a result?</li>
  <li>What is your data ecosystem?</li>
  <li>Can you export and import the data to other systems?</li>
  <li>Will you analyse the search terms used and optimise your content accordingly?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="data-access">Data access</h4>

<p>Will you email reports or will people want their own dashboard?</p>

<h4 id="implementation-of-tools">Implementation of tools</h4>

<p>If you use intend to use a cloud service, have you read the <a href="http://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/ism/index.htm">Australian Signals Directorate’s Information Security Manual Principles?</a> What code required to be inserted and where? Who can do this for you?</p>

<h4 id="data-granularity">Data granularity</h4>

<p>Will you and your agency be satisfied with knowing just the general level of traffic to your site, or do you want to be able to track by action on a page?</p>

<h4 id="record-keeping">Record keeping</h4>

<p>How long do you need to keep a record of data? Some analytics services only give you the last 3 months.</p>

<h4 id="return-on-investment">Return on investment</h4>

<p>Do you require a commercial-off-the-shelf product? Have you investigated free tools such as <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>?</p>

<h4 id="cms-data">CMS data</h4>

<p>Don’t assume that the content management system (CMS) will supply enough data.</p>

<h4 id="team-capability-and-support">Team capability and support</h4>

<p>Some tools are easier to use than others. However, with a gain in usability you may lose depth of data and functionality.</p>

<h4 id="existing-analytical-skills">Existing analytical skills</h4>

<p>Understanding and analysing data well is not easy and you should consider that the role may require tertiary analysis skills. People in this role also need good communication skills to understand what users of the data are looking for and how the data can be best used and presented. You should consider training and development in interpretation and use of analytics for your team and any main users at your agency.</p>

<h3 id="ensure-data-security">Ensure data security</h3>

<p>It is important to understand your obligations on how to handle and secure data. There is more information available in the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/big-data">APS better practice guide for big data</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ip-masking">IP masking</h4>

<p><img src="../../sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/importanticon.png%3Fitok=9UI4A82t" alt="Important" title="Important" /> You should ensure your configuration complies with current Australian Privacy Principles, including settings such as Internet Protocol (IP) Masking.</p>

<p>Contractors such as Google and Doubleclick are not obliged at this stage to meet Australian Government privacy requirements. If you are using Google Analytics you should follow these <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2905384?hl=en">steps for turning on IP Masking</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the Department of Finance has configured 5 of their online products to utilise Google Analytics, enabling Finance’s online products team to access reports about general site usage. This is not unusual, even for government sites, and all sites contain an explanation of how Google Analytics is used.</p>

<p>Google Analytics uses the IP address of devices that connect to a website to identify what part of the world users come from, for analysis purposes. Finance has elected to activate the standard Google Analytics IP masking feature (which prevents Google from seeing actual IP addresses) and users also have the ability to disable Google Analytics on their device.</p>

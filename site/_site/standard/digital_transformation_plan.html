<h1 id="digital-transformation-plan">Digital Transformation Plan</h1>

<p>Supporting agencies to transform their service delivery</p>

<p>The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is supporting agencies in planning their transformation to provide users with a better experience when dealing with government. The DTO has established a network of <a href="../node/digital_transformation_coordinators.md">Digital Transformation Coordinators</a> (DTCs) that supports each agency in the development of a Digital Transformation Plan and progress of services through digital transformation.</p>

<h2 id="digital-transformation-plan-1">Digital Transformation Plan</h2>

<p>All non-corporate Commonwealth agencies (most former <em>Financial Management Accountability Act 1997</em> agencies) with high volume transaction services (that is, 50,000 transactions per annum) <a href="../node/scope_of_the_digital_service_standard.md">in scope of the Standard</a> are required to develop and publish a Digital Transformation Plan.</p>

<p>The Digital Transformation Plan enables agencies to be transparent about their planned transformation activities and report on their progress against the <a href="../node/2015_16_digital_transformation_agenda_budget_initiatives.md">Digital Transformation Agenda</a>. </p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>Your plan should explain the current service offerings and the user needs to be met, the vision for the agency, and how it will get there.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where we are now</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>service users and their requirements; how the agency engages with its users around service delivery, and detail of current services</li>
      <li>strategic context and direction for the agency and its digital transformation, including current initiatives to digitise services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The future</strong>: the vision for the digitally transformed agency.</li>
  <li><strong>How we will get there</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>identification of specific aspects of services that can be transformed quickly and enable significant improvements to the user experience</li>
      <li>identification, prioritisation and planning the transformation of high volume transactional services to comply with the <a href="digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard</a></li>
      <li>an action plan that addresses the changes required at the organisational, cultural and capability levels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preparing-your-plan">Preparing your plan</h3>

<p>The DTO will work with agencies to provide assistance in preparing and submitting their plan.</p>

<p>The Digital Transformation Plans will provide data for reporting service transformation on the DTO dashboard. The transformation planning process is being supported through workshops and guidance from the DTO. You can keep an eye on our regular <a href="../news-media/blog.1.html">blog updates</a> and contact your DTC for more information.</p>

<p>Agencies with high volume transactional services must submit plans to the DTO by September 2015.  </p>

<h3 id="reporting-progress">Reporting progress</h3>

<p>Agencies are required to report progress against their plan. This information will automatically populate a whole-of-government reporting dashboard.</p>

<p>Agency plans will be reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or as required. This reflects alignment with the Digital Transformation Agenda and changes to agency service delivery.</p>

<h2 id="transformation-phases">Transformation phases</h2>

<p>Transformation planning will be different for every agency, however agencies are expected to address 4 key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agency preparation</li>
  <li>Agency capability</li>
  <li>Transformation implementation</li>
  <li>Evaluation and assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="agency-preparation">Agency preparation</h3>

<p>An agency needs to plan to transform its overall approach to service delivery, and how its high volume transactional services will be transformed. Agencies should consider the adoption of common platforms and joined-up services across government could accelerate their transformation without duplicating effort or investing in non-aligned initiatives.</p>

<p>Key elements in planning agency transformation include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leadership and culture – is it strong, well placed, does it need attention?</li>
  <li>Level of digital engagement with users</li>
  <li>Portfolio and organisational management – governance, structure</li>
  <li>Compliance and processes; for example, processes to check the service aligns with <a href="digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard</a></li>
  <li>Service delivery partnerships; for example, with third parties</li>
  <li>Digital capabilities; including people, information and technology</li>
  <li>Service delivery contestability – is there a way to redesign the service in a way that is commercially contestable?</li>
</ul>

<p>Agencies must prioritise the services that need to transform first and consider the common platforms and solutions they will adopt in line with the criteria set out in the Digital Service Standard. Considerations for prioritising include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying high volume transaction services where digital improvements will benefit a lot of users</li>
  <li>opportunity to do a short, sharp piece of work to transform a user service (or important aspects of it)</li>
  <li>user services where a high proportion of potential users are already online, providing opportunities to rapidly achieve high digital take-up</li>
  <li>breaks in contract provision, where a significant change offers an opportunity for a reappraisal of what is delivered and how</li>
  <li>services currently perceived as problematic or ‘failing’, where a transformational re-design will reduce user frustration or lead to savings through operational efficiencies</li>
  <li>‘greenfield’ opportunities to introduce new digital services</li>
  <li>opportunities across departments to provide more holistic, integrated, streamlined and connected services to users.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="agency-capability">Agency capability</h3>

<p>Agencies need enterprise-wide service level capability to support digital transformation. This involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having the digital skills and capability to build services that are simple and easy to use</li>
  <li>addressing potential barriers to going digital (such as legislative, technical, infrastructure, service complexity, and so on)</li>
  <li>catering for the needs of people who require <a href="../node/assisted_digital.md">assisted digital</a> support</li>
  <li>plans to integrate non-digital services with digital ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transformation-implementation">Transformation implementation</h3>

<p>Agencies need to use an integrated approach, based on user needs, to build internal capability as well as services. Agencies should translate user needs into services that are simple and intuitive enough so that users succeed digitally, first time, every time. The <a href="../node/principles_of_digital_service_design.md">digital service design principles</a> should underpin agency implementation.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation-and-assessment">Evaluation and assessment</h3>

<p>Evaluating the progress of the organisation and its service transformation is crucial. A dashboard will support a whole-of-government view of agency progress in the digitisation and transformation of high volume services. Given the early stages for digital transformation within Australian Government, guidance on this phase will continue to be refined.</p>

<p>Some questions to consider include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Has the agency increased its digital capability?</li>
  <li>What is the agency’s capability to engage with users and undertake user-centred design, including prototyping and user testing?</li>
  <li>Do service delivery staff have the appropriate knowledge and skills as well as access to the digital transformation process?</li>
  <li>Does the service comply with the <a href="digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard</a>?</li>
  <li>Does the new service meet the key needs of the user and address user-engagement trends?</li>
  <li>What proportion of the service is now digital?</li>
  <li>What is the level of sophistication of the digital aspects of your services?</li>
  <li>Does the digital service integrate seamlessly?</li>
</ul>

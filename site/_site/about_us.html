<h1 id="about-us">About us</h1>

<p>Every day, more Australians choose to interact with government on their mobiles, tablets and computers rather than face-to-face or over the phone.</p>

<p>That’s why the Digital Transformation Office (or DTO) has been created - to lead the government in transforming our services to improve your experience.</p>

<p>We’re working closely with individuals, businesses and industries as well as with Australian Government departments.</p>

<p>We’re identifying where improvements are most urgently needed, and re-designing these services from the ground up.</p>

<p>If you agree that dealing with the government should be (at least) as quick and easy as dealing with any other business, please <a href="engage.md">get in touch</a> to see how you can work with us.</p>

<p>You can also keep up with us online though our <a href="news-media/blog.1.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ausdto">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://govspace.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=18f172213d32ca205c7e524bd&amp;id=172d06cc83">mailing list</a>.</p>

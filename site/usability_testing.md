Usability testing
=================

Learning from your users

Usability testing helps assess how usable a service is by watching how users actually use it, rather than relying on what they say. It answers questions like:

-   How easy is the service to use?
-   How easy is the service to learn?
-   How fast can a user accomplish tasks using the service?
-   After using the service once, can a user remember enough to use it effectively the next time?
-   How much do your users like using your service?

Usability testing allows designers and developers to identify problems early on and fix them before a service is released more broadly.

Why must I?
-----------

User testing is an important part of the development and evaluation process, and helps to ensure that online services are as effective as possible. The quantifiable benefits that can be achieved through early and continued usability testing include:

-   increased productivity
-   decreased user training requirements
-   decreased number of calls to the help desk and need for technical support
-   decreased user error rates
-   decreased programming costs associated with late design
-   decreased maintenance costs.

### Determine approach

As with any [user research](node/user_research.md), the methods you select depend on your research objectives and the available time, budget and resources you have. At the most basic level, a usability test session involves participants trying to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.

More sophisticated usability testing will take advantage of technology to record session data, such as page visits, mouse clicks, eye movements, and facial expressions.

Although it is common to test in a usability lab, it is not required. You can even test quickly and cheaply out in the field using [guerrilla testing](node/performance_testing.md#guerrilla). With the right software, you can also do usability testing with the user in a different location which can be moderated or unmoderated.

To determine your usability testing approach:

1.  **Develop a test plan** with your stakeholders outlining your objectives, the questions you’ll ask and the characteristics of the people who will be testing the design. As part of the plan, identify representative tasks based on likely scenarios or use cases and establish clear success criteria for each task. Success criteria can include successful task completion, number of errors, time spent on the task, user satisfaction and comfort ratings.
2.  **Identify representative users** and recruit them, keeping in mind that different user groups may need to perform different tasks based on their likely usage patterns. Note you can usually uncover most of your usability problems with only [5 participants](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/). You should [include users with disability](node/inclusive_services.md) to ensure accessibility barriers are uncovered.
3.  If available, use **usability testing recording software** to record how the user interacts with the interface (for example, on the computer screen) and their voice and facial expressions during testing. Software can also track mouse clicks, key strokes, and active and open windows.

### Conduct research

Gather your data through the methods you have selected. We will be adding more guidance on research methodology and planning as the Digital Service Design Guide develops. There is some initial guidance available that introduces some of the common [user research](node/user_research.md) methods.

You should:

1.  compile the data to determine the severity of each usability issue that was encountered
2.  prioritise your recommended improvements
3.  implement the recommendations
4.  re-test to assess the effectiveness of your changes
5.  share your findings.

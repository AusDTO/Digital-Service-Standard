Great talent was on show this week at the Digital Canberra
[iAwards](https://www.aiia.com.au/?page=iawards) with some of Canberra’s
top ICT innovation leaders, start-ups, entrepreneurs and students
honoured for their work.

Amongst the winners were several examples of great government
innovation.

The National Blood Authority are likely to be on the hunt for a bigger
trophy cabinet after picking up no less than four prizes for their
[Bloodnet](http://www.nba.gov.au/bloodnet) project. The web-based system
automates the real-time exchange of critical blood stocks in hospitals.
This frees up hospital staff from the time-consuming job of manually
monitoring blood supply and enables them to step-in and quickly address
any problems.

[The Dandelion
Program](http://www.mhs.gov.au/media/media_releases/2015/02/03_02_2015_-_australian_first_employment_model_for_people_with_autism)
– a collaboration between Hewlett Packard Australia, the Department of
Human Services and Specialisterne, known as the Specialist People
Foundation – picked up an award in the society domain. Their
collaboration offers people with Autism Spectrum Disorder a way to
leverage their strengths and gain skilled employment in the field of ICT
software testing.

Organised criminals should be looking over their shoulder with the
Australian Crime Commission-led [National Criminal Intelligence Fusion
Capability](https://www.crimecommission.gov.au/organised-crime/joint-task-forces-and-initiatives/national-criminal-intelligence-fusion-capability)
to support the response to serious and organised crime. For their
award-winning project, the Commission brought together subject matter
experts, investigators and analysts, data and tools across all levels of
government to generate intelligence to better respond to serious and
organised criminal threats. This has led to the discovery of previously
unknown criminal threats and links between organisations.

A full list of the winners can be found

Meet Paul Shetler…

Hi everyone – it’s fantastic to be here!

My goal is for Australia to become the country that shows the rest of
the world how to deliver superb public services – across all channels –
that are designed around the needs of users first and foremost.

I feel very privileged to join the team leading that charge.

I’d first like to thank and congratulate the acting CEO of the DTO,
David Hazlehurst, and his brilliant team for the great work they’ve done
and the excellent progress they’ve made so far.

It’s a great time to be working in public sector service redesign. A
global movement is well underway: with the costs of new technologies
going down, governments everywhere are focusing their efforts on service
redesign to deliver the high quality experience that users deserve.

With strong digital and design skills across the public and private
sectors, Australia is well-placed to take advantage of lessons learnt by
other countries in the course of digitising their public services.

A bit about me: I’ve co-founded two start-ups, worked in two others and
also been in leadership roles at large suppliers like Oracle, Microsoft,
and the global payments network, SWIFT.

More recently I’ve been transforming the way government delivers public
services, and have been loving every minute of it.

When I was at the UK’s Government Digital Service, I helped develop a
suite of practical lessons from its work to transform 25 exemplar
services.   

Before that, I was Chief Digital Officer at the UK Ministry of Justice
(where I helped deliver four of those 25 exemplar services).

From these experiences, I’ve refined an approach to eating the elephant
of service transformation. I like to keep things fast and simple, by
starting small with things that provide real value to users, by
delivering them quickly and then by continuing to rapidly improve them.
I gave a talk about this a few months ago which you can [view
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B6rFO59kU4).

Hi Paul and welcome to Australia!

You've got a big task in front of you, but the momentum built here over
the last eight years will work in your favour.

Having visited the GDS, I'm hopeful that you can create and sustain a
similar environment and culture here.

You have some good people in the team already, and I know a number (both
inside and outside the public sector) interested in working in or with
the DTO if opportunity permits.

Cheers,

Craig

Great to see the government filling this position with an expert who has
a diverse background. Adding value quickly and simply is a great
approach to the challenges ahead.

All the best\

Paul - Welcome to Australia in your new role at the DTO. Looking forward
to seeing some of the energy and attitude I saw at GDS influencing the
approach taken by the DTO. Since first starting to talk about this in
2009, "Fast and simple" sounds exactly like what is needed to move
forward now.

Hi Paul

It is great to have you here! Am imagining you have already discovered
the enthusiastic digital government community: we see lots of positives
and power in pooling end user insights and achieving joint action across
government, business, NFPs, open government and social enterprise
movements.

Public Sector Innovation Month, now on until the end of July, has
kickstarted more pragmatic dialogue than ever about cross-sector
projects and role of collaboration in boosting innovation in the Public
Service. (Some highlights at @govhackau @psinnovate \#psinnovate15
@govcampau) Look forward to continuing the dialogue, your IPAA session
and making good progress.

Cheers!

Meeting the Standard {#page-title .page__title .title}
====================

Does the service meet the Standard?

All services within the [scope of the
Standard](/standard/scope-digital-service-standard) must be assessed
against the criteria of the [Standard](/standard) at each phase of
service development.

The agency who owns the service must make sure their service meets and
maintains the Standard, whether it is designed, built and operated by
in-house, external or mixed teams. If a service does not meet the
Standard it should not progress to the next phase.

Helping you meet the Standard is important.

1.  [Assurance against the Standard](#assurance) - how to self-assess,
    provide evidence and report
2.  [Keeping the Standard](#keeping) - ensuring your service continues
    to meet the Standard
3.  [Failing to meet the Standard](#failing) - help is available 

Assurance against the Standard {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
------------------------------

### Assessment and reporting

Services should be assessed against the relevant criteria of the
Standard at each of the development phases. Hence, services should be
assessed at least four times before going live:

-   following the discovery phase
-   during alpha development
-   during beta development
-   just before going live.

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is developing the assessment
framework, tools and checklists to support agencies in assessing and
reporting their service against the Standard.

Service teams and Digital Transformation Coordinators must be satisfied
that they have met the relevant criteria of the Standard. Once
satisfied, the agency will report their progression to the next phase on
a Digital Service Dashboard (currently being developed) and provide
their assessment report.  

If support is needed to assess the service, the DTO can help -
please [contact us](/contact-us).

### Providing evidence {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Publishing good, frequent information about how services are performing
is really important. It not only demonstrates commitment to meeting the
Standard, but also:

-   contributes to a government-wide repository of best practice
-   provides a resource for other teams redesigning or building services
-   provides an easy way to share ideas within and across departments.

Consider a public blog to collect and publish progress. Publishing such
a blog means that people from inside and outside government can follow
the development of a service, allowing teams to quickly get feedback and
test their assumptions with a wider community.

It also means that there is a published audit trail of progress to
support the assessment process.

Keeping the Standard {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
--------------------

The launch of a service is only the beginning. Once it has been
released, users become important judges of its quality. Having designed
the service to be iteratively developed using performance data and user
research, service teams will have all the information they need to
continuously improve the service. Performance against the key indicators
will be tracked and publicly displayed on a Digital Service Dashboard.

In keeping the Standard, service teams must:

-   update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback,
    performance data, changes to best practice and service demand
-   contribute to best practice developed across government to be shared
    through the Design Guide
-   show high levels of user satisfaction are maintained in the digital
    and assisted digital service
-   show high levels of transaction completion are maintained in the
    digital and assisted digital service
-   show cost per transaction is decreasing in line with plans submitted
    ahead of the service’s launch
-   show digital take-up is increasing in line with plans submitted
    ahead of the service’s launch, and [assisted digital
    support](/design-guides/guide/assisted-digital) is targeted at the
    people who really need it.

Failing to meet the standard {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
----------------------------

A service may fail to meet the Standard at 2 points:

1.  during service design prior to going live, or
2.  when live, if it falls below the agencies performance targets.

### Failure during service design {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Progress towards meeting the Standard should be assessed and reported at
every phase the service passes through.

If the agency team performing the assessment aren’t satisfied that a
service meets the relevant criteria of the Standard, the service should
not progress to the next phase. Where an assessment fails to progress a
service, [help is available](/contact-us).

### Ongoing performance {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

The DTO will use assessment reports and the Digital Service Dashboard to
monitor service performance. This includes identifying services that are
failing to maintain the performance targets set by agencies. Where a
service does not meet its benchmarks, the DTO will work with Digital
Transformation Coordinators and Service Managers to resolve the issue.

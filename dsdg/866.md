Principles of digital service design {#page-title .page__title .title}
====================================

Guiding principles to design better services

The design principles provide the foundation for the Digital Service
Standard’s [service design process](/standard/service-design-process).

1. Users first {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
--------------

*Users generally interact with government out of necessity rather than
choice. Put the needs of users first so they can access the information
and services they need quickly and efficiently.*

Identify the people **who** will use the service,
understand **what** they do,** how **they do it**, when** they do it
and **why**.

2. Have a clear purpose {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
-----------------------

*Understand (really understand) the problem or outcome you are designing
for.*

Articulate why a change is being made, before designing it. Be clear on
the intent and what the driver is for change. Make sure everyone has the
same understanding.

3. Keep it simple {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
-----------------

*Government is complicated, but interacting with it should be simple.*

Our backend systems need to be complex to achieve the sophistication
necessary to deliver streamlined, easy-to-use information and services.
But we need to do the hard work so users aren’t faced with this
complexity.

4. Work together {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
----------------

*Working collaboratively and openly results in a better chance of
generating ideas and problem solving than working alone.*

Involve government and industry to form multidisciplinary teams which
have a diverse range of skills, expertise and experience. Bring in the
right people at the right time throughout the design process.

5. Innovate and experiment {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
--------------------------

*Experimentation is critical to innovation.*

Challenge the status quo and take considered risks by exploring
possibilities, testing concepts and asking questions.

6. Design end to end {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
--------------------

*Design for a holistic user experience, not a series of standalone
products or services.*

One small change can significantly change a user’s experience with
government. It’s not an improvement if it makes another service harder.

7. Use data to make decisions {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
-----------------------------

*Do the research and use evidence and analytics to inform your
decisions.*

Don’t design based on assumptions. Use research and data to inform
decisions and value this over opinions.

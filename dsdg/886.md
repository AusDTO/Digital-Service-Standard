Common government solutions {#page-title .page__title .title}
===========================

Using common solutions to design better services

We can improve the user experience and efficiency of our services by
using common government solutions and shared platforms wherever
possible.

There are several common solutions, platforms and web services already
available across government or under development in the Digital
Transformation Office (DTO). We have a [consolidated list of all common
platforms and web
services](https://data.gov.au/dataset/common-platforms-and-web-services) which
are available for reuse by agencies and some by third parties. We will
keep this list up to date, and below is some additional information on a
few common platforms the DTO is involved in. If you know of any
additional common platforms or web services, please let us know via the
feedback form below.

Tell Us Once {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
------------

We're working to make it easier for people to 'Tell Us Once' about their
changing circumstances. For individuals, this means they will be able to
update their contact details once via
their [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) account and have the update shared
with Centrelink, Medicare and the Australian Tax Office. In June, we
will expand this to include email address and phone details and extend
it to more services.

For businesses, were working on a Tell Us Once service using Australian
Business Register. 

myGov Inbox {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
-----------

Another shared platform we're working on is
the [myGov Inbox](https://my.gov.au). The myGov Inbox is a government
digital mail service for people enabling them to receive government mail
electronically rather than by paper. A few agencies like Centrelink and
Medicare are already using the myGov Inbox and the Australian Tax Office
will commence using it shortly.

Digital Identity {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
----------------

We're working on the development of a National Trusted Digital Identity
Framework designed to ensure a consistent approach to identity,
authentication and authorisation across all our services. 

We are working with agencies and the users of our services to see how
best to improve and expand these common solutions across government. As
with all new government services and solutions, Tell Us Once
and myGov Inbox are built on open, interoperable standards.

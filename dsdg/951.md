New services for business {#page-title .page__title .title}
=========================

The Government is committed to making it quicker and more affordable for
business to transact with government online and will deliver a number of
significant new services for business.

A new Digital Business Account
------------------------------

A new Digital Business Account will be created to make it easier for the
more than 2 million Australian businesses to access government services
in a safe and secure online channel.

The new account will incorporate a digital mailbox and a ‘Tell Us Once’
service.

As with the myGov service, this will mean that businesses will be able
to receive messages from government agencies in the one secure account
and enable businesses to update their contact information once, and for
this information to then be sent to relevant government agencies.

The new account will become available in mid-2016 and replace the
existing Australian Business Account.

Complementing the AUSkey system, businesses will be able to use myGov
credentials for their transactions with government.

This will provide a streamlined user experience and reduce the
regulatory burden for businesses.

It also means that businesses will be able to interact with government
in one place rather than via a variety of digital, face-to-face, or
telephony channels across multiple agencies.

Single Business Registration
----------------------------

The Digital Transformation Agenda will also include the implementation
of a Streamlined Business Registration service announced in the [Jobs
and Small Business
package](http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/glossy/sml_bus/html/sml_bus-04.htm).

Business registration will be streamlined with a single online
registration site. This will fix the currently fragmented and complex
process, saving time and money.\

Service design process {#page-title .page__title .title}
======================

Focussing on users’ experience to design and deliver better solutions

The service design process is an iterative and flexible approach which
ensures users are involved in the design and development of new
services.

The process consists of 3 phases:

1.  [Discover and Define](#discoverdefine)
2.  [Create and Iterate](#createiterate)
3.  [Deliver, Evaluate and Improve](#deliverevaluateimprove).

You can move between the phases at any time. Services that can no longer
be improved should be considered for [retirement](#retire).

The phases are supported by [design
principles](/standard/design-principles) to ensure good design outcomes
are achieved.

Process](https://www.dto.gov.au/sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/service_design_graphic_v3.png?itok=1az-zZpd "Service Design Process")

 

Why must I?
-----------

Taking a design approach helps us to deliver useful and usable services
based on evidence about what is:

-   desirable from a user perspective
-   possible through technology and legislation
-   viable from an Australian Government perspective.

What do I do in each phase?
---------------------------

### 1. Discover and Define

Clarify the problem or opportunity for change, understand and come to an
agreed view on the following questions.

-   Who are the users?
-   What are the drivers for the change?
-   What are the benefits for users and government?
-   What is the desired outcome and the rationale behind it?
-   Who is impacted by the change?
-   What challenges exist that may impact the change?
-   What behaviour is expected as a result of the change?

#### *Undertake user research *

Identify your users and get to know them. Analyse existing or undertake
new [user research](/design-guides/guide/user-research) to: 

-   get valuable insight into users’ expectations of future government
    services, or their experience and thoughts on an existing service
-   understand more about users’ overall experience with government, not
    just the service you are designing
-   understand what proportion of your users will need [assisted digital
    support](/design-guides/guide/assisted-digital).

#### *Conduct environmental scan* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Understand the context for the user and government including any
possible impacts the change will have on existing services. Analyse
policy and legislation to identify any barriers. This may require
updating the policy to support the outcomes you want to achieve.

Review existing data, systems and content that may be able to be reused
to support the delivery of the services.

This should provide you with a better understanding of the legacy
interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing
processes are in place for replacing or decommissioning services.

#### *Form the team* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Identify and bring together stakeholders and core members to form [the
team](/design-guides/guide/team).

#### *Get together* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Run a series of [workshops](/design-guides/subguides/workshops) with the
team. Start with an ABCD approach to drive a conversation and develop
supporting documentation.

1.  Where are we now?
2.  Where do we want to be?
3.  How will we get there?
4.  What will need to be done?

#### *Tools* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

-   [Workshops](/design-guides/subguides/workshops)
-   [High level design](/design-guides/subguides/high-level-design)
-   ABCD modelling
-   [Personas](/design-guides/subguides/personas) and
    [scenarios](/design-guides/subguides/scenarios)
-   [User
    pathways](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/user-pathways)

-   [Prototypes](/design-guides/subguides/prototyping)
-   Sketches / whiteboard diagrams
-   [KPI assessment](/standard/digital-transformation-plan/measurement)

### 2. Create and Iterate {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Create and iterate an end-to-end solution that fits within the natural
pathway of users

-   Research, design and test with users in an iterative way to ensure
    the service fits their needs
-   Balance user needs with the government agenda when exploring options
    and designing services, taking into consideration their environment
    and constraints
-   Concentrate on delivering services which make the [user
    journey](/design-guides/subguides/user-pathways) and experience as
    simple, clear and as fast as possible while maintaining integrity of
    the service

#### *Develop options* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Develop options by using [user
research](/design-guides/guide/user-research) and involving a wide range
of stakeholders from the private, industry and other parts of the public
sector. Run a series of workshops with these stakeholders to develop
your options.

When considering options, agree on what operational support
and resourcing is needed to maintain the service or product
post-production and who will provide it.

#### *Test early and test often* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Create and share the emerging design and thinking as early as possible.
Be willing to share your
draft [wireframes](/design-guides/subguides/wireframing) or [prototypes](/design-guides/subguides/prototyping) with
increasing detail and functionality (for example, low and high fidelity
prototypes). Keep in mind people are less likely to provide feedback on
something that looks finished. Early engagement and consultation will
help you to:

-   grasp concepts quickly
-   promote discussion and feedback
-   progress the design in a collaborative way
-   ensure transparency of the emerging design
-   identify design issues early.

The initial design shouldn’t be a fully developed solution but it should
have enough information and detail, including real data where possible,
to demonstrate its use. As you iterate you should be working towards
prototypes that users can test in their ‘real’ environment (for example,
in their workplace or on their preferred smartphone platform) but
remember the overall goal is to make something quickly and test it
early.

Run design walkthroughs. They are an effective visual way to show
stakeholders the progress of the design. Walkthroughs help with early
validation of design decisions, and are an efficient way to get feedback
from several people at once.

notes](https://www.dto.gov.au/sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/Walkthrough_2_1.jpg?itok=d0sVlZjw)

*An example of a design walkthrough: a team member uses a diagram across
a long wall to demonstrate a user’s experience through the whole
service.*

#### *Capture and document* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Capture and document insights obtained from the user research activities
you undertake in this phase. Document your designs throughout
development including why certain decisions were made. Knowing why the
service was designed that way will make it easier when making future
improvements.

#### *Tools* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

-   [User research](/design-guides/guide/user-research)
-   [Workshops](/design-guides/subguides/workshops)
-   [User pathways](/design-guides/subguides/user-pathways)
-   [High level design /
    blueprints](/design-guides/subguides/high-level-design)
-   [Prototyping](/design-guides/subguides/prototyping)
-   [Usability testing](/design-guides/guide/usability-testing)
-   [User stories](/design-guides/subguides/user-stories)

### 3. Deliver, Evaluate and Improve {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Deliver the service according to feedback received during [usability
testing](/design-guides/guide/usability-testing). As far as possible
think about the future changing needs of users and aim to
support scalability to accommodate changes.  

#### *Go live* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Check the service meets the Australian Government requirements
on [accessibility](/design-guides/guide/making-content-accessible), [branding](/design-guides/guide/branding) and [common
website elements](/design-guides/guide/common-website-elements).

Ensure your analytics are configured accurately to monitor the [key
performance
indicators](/standard/digital-transformation-plan/measurement) identified
in building your service.

Make sure you have planned the transition or integration of any existing
services.

Once the tested product meets all security, government and performance
requirements it is ready to go live.

#### *Monitor the service* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Gather and assess stakeholder and user feedback.
Analyse dashboard results to identify issues that can be improved or
problems that need to be fixed. When deciding how to address problems it
is important to consider them in context.

-   Why was the service created?
-   What is the desired user experience?
-   How does the service integrate with other government services?

When evaluating the service it is important to identify if it is not
meeting its intended purpose or is triggering unexpected consequences to
other Australian Government services. You should also think of the
opportunities for future improvements.

Monitoring of the service should allow sufficient time to cover usage
periods and the range of user activities.

#### *Influence future design and improvements* {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}

Services will continue to undergo evaluation and improvement; reacting
to new needs and demands of the wider environment.

You may need to repeat the whole design process for smaller pieces of
work as the service continues running. Find something that needs
improvement; research solutions; iterate; and release. That should be a
constant rhythm for the [operating team](/design-guides/guide/team), and
done rapidly.

Retiring a service {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
------------------

When it is clear a service is no longer required, or those particular
user needs are better met through a different service, it may be time to
retire it.

![Attention](https://www.dto.gov.au/sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png?itok=wqHBFd4O "Attention")** Legislative
requirements**: there are [records management
requirements](/design-guides/guide/records-management) under
the [*Archives Act
1983*](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796) and [*Evidence Act
1995*](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/) for
Australian Government agencies.

In parallel to the work required to retire a services, and sometimes
during the 3 phases, it will be necessary to archive content and records
relating to the service. Whenever content is removed from a site you
must consider the [records managing
requirements](/design-guides/guide/records-management) and appropriate
archiving actions. ‘Archiving’, in this case meaning taking material out
of active use and storing it elsewhere.

If there is an agency need to retain the material for an extended time,
and it is not eligible for transfer to the National Archives of
Australia, you will need to put in place preservation strategies to make
sure the information being archived will remain accessible in the
future, even after multiple changes to hardware and software.

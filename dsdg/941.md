2015-16 Digital Transformation Agenda Budget initiatives {#page-title .page__title .title}
========================================================

The Government is investing in the Digital Transformation Agenda (the
Agenda) to drive innovation and make it easier for individuals and
businesses to access government services.

This year’s Budget provides \$254.7m over four years from 2015-16 to
support the initial implementation of the Agenda. This includes \$95.4m
to fund the operation of the Digital Transformation Office as well as
funding for the implementation of the projects that form stage one of
the Agenda. More information can be found in the Minister for
Communications, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull’s [media
release](http://www.minister.communications.gov.au/malcolm_turnbull/news/investing_in_digital_transformation).

Our CEO highlights the transformation in his [2015-16 Budget
blog](/news-media/blog/digital-transformation-agenda-2015-16-federal-budget).
Further information on stage-one projects is below.  

New services for individuals
----------------------------

The Government is committed to radically transforming service delivery
to Australians. This will be achieved through a number of [new services
for individuals](/budget/new-services-individuals), which will make it
easier and faster for people to access services across multiple
agencies.

New services for business
-------------------------

The Government is also committed to making it quicker and more
affordable for business to transact with government online and will
deliver [new services for business](/budget/new-services-business).  

The Digital Service Standard 
-----------------------------

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard) will
establish a consistent digital-by-design approach to government service
delivery. It will apply to all government agencies to make services
simpler and easier to use.

Trusted Digital Identity Framework
----------------------------------

The [Trusted Digital Identity
Framework](/budget/trusted-digital-identity-framework) will provide
individuals and businesses with easier ways to access government
services through the use of government or private digital identities.

Better grants administration
----------------------------

The [better grants administration](/budget/better-grants-administration)
initiative will streamline and simplify grants administration processes
across 12 agencies, making the management of grants simpler and more
efficient for government, applicants, and grant recipients.

The Agenda will also include the implementation of a Streamlined
Business Registration service announced in the [Jobs and Small Business
package](http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/glossy/sml_bus/html/sml_bus-04.htm).
This will simplify the process of registering a business. \

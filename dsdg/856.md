Scope of the Digital Service Standard {#page-title .page__title .title}
=====================================

The [Digital Service Standard](/standard) (the Standard) applies to all
existing and new Australian Government (federal) services that are:

-   [high volume transaction services](#_High_volume_Ttransaction) (for
    example, lodging a tax return online) 
-   [digital information services](#_Digital_information_services) (for
    example, an agency website and its publications).

These services must be the responsibility of, or partly owned and/or
operated or funded by, a government department or agency ([PGPA Act
non-Corporate
entity](http://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/introduction/)).
The Standard does not apply to state/territory or local government
services. However, these jurisdictions may elect to apply the Standard
to service delivery.

High volume transaction services {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
--------------------------------

A digital service must meet the Standard before it can go live, if it
is:

-   the responsibility of, or partly owned and/or operated or funded by,
    a government department or agency
-   completely new and/or being redesigned
-   processing (or likely to process) more than 50,000 transactions
    every year.

If the service does not meet one or more of the criteria outlined above
then it may not have to meet the Standard. For further clarity, [contact
us](/contact-us) for advice.

If the service is already operating, the agency responsible will need to
provide a [Digital Transformation
Plan](/standard/digital-transformation-plan), by September 2015, on how
it will adopt the Standard.

Digital information services {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
----------------------------

All information that is the responsibility of, or is partly owned and/or
funded by, an Australian Government department or agency is subject to
the Digital Service Standard, including reports and other publications.
If the information is completely new then, from June 2015, it must meet
the Standard before it can go live.

Existing websites and publications will also need to be updated to
follow the Standard. Australian Government agencies must provide
a [Digital Transformation
Plan](/standard/digital-transformation-plan) outlining how they will
adopt the Standard for each of their information services by September
2015.

Personal ministerial websites (that contain material on a minister’s
party political activities or views on issues not related to their
ministerial role) are **not **included in the scope of the Standard.

The Standard may not apply to everything {style="line-height: 22.15px;"}
----------------------------------------

Australian Government services cover a vast variety of activities
including some highly specialised services with very few transactions.
Applying the Standard to services dealing with only a handful of
transactions may have little benefit. Similarly, legislative and/or
technical barriers may prevent some services transitioning to the
Standard, either in full or in part. These will need to be addressed
over time. 

Full or partial exemptions from the Standard may be appropriate in
certain cases – [contact us](/contact-us) for advice.

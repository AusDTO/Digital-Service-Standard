Trusted Digital Identity Framework {#page-title .page__title .title}
==================================

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will work across government and
with the private sector to develop a Trusted Digital Identity Framework
(the Framework) to support the Government’s Digital Transformation
Agenda.

The Framework will establish a set of principles and standards for the
use of accredited government and third-party digital identities to
enable individuals and businesses to access services easier.

This will involve establishing a common strategic approach to identity
across government and preventing agencies from investing in bespoke
solutions.

This will mean that individuals and businesses will no longer have to
prove their identity multiple times to government when accessing
services.

The Framework will provide users with choice and control in establishing
their digital identity. The wider use of digital identities will improve
access to services, new products and markets for consumers and industry,
and more productive ways of doing business.

It will also reduce the burden of managing the ever-growing number of
unique digital credentials.

For government, it will deliver significant efficiencies and savings,
avoiding the duplication of services, infrastructure, maintenance,
licencing, and sustainment costs.

The Framework will also take into account privacy and security
requirements consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles and
existing government security standards.\

How to measure and monitor digital services

It’s essential to measure and monitor how your service is performing, so
you can make sure it continues to meet user needs in a cost-effective
and efficient way. Use of simple metrics provides a way to identify the
strengths and weaknesses of your service and will help your team to
identify ways to improve your service over time.

Key performance indicators {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
--------------------------

The [Digital Service Standard](/standard) requires regular reporting of
4 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the ongoing performance
of your service.

1.  **Cost per transaction** - the total estimated cost of your service
    per month (it varies for some services) divided by the number of
    completed transactions.
2.  **Digital take-up** - the percentage of your target take-up audience
    you have reached.
3.  **Completion rate** - a percentage of completed transactions from
    started transactions.
4.  **User satisfaction** - are users happy with the service you’ve
    provided? This will be determined from two sources: web metrics and
    user surveys.

These aren’t the only things your service should measure. There are
other unique indicators that will help you judge the effectiveness of
your service.

-   **[Analytic
    tools](/design-guides/guide/analytics-tools) **- choosing the right
    tools to measure your service.
-   **Other performance indicators** - other metrics your service might
    measure or track.
-   **Using open data** - how to make use of the performance information
    your service collects.

What happens to your data {style="line-height: 22.1520004272461px;"}
-------------------------

Once live, the performance of your service will be displayed on
a Digital Service Dashboard. This data will be presented in modules
capable of being uniquely configured. These will be automated to update
monthly and (where possible) will be visible to the public.

A new approach to the design and delivery of digital services starts
today with the release of the [alpha Digital Service
Standard](http://www.dto.gov.au/standard). The standard establishes the
criteria that all Australian digital government services must meet to
ensure they are simpler, faster and easier to use.

Most people expect to be able to access government services and
information anytime and from anywhere, using any internet-connected
device. They expect services to be simple, seamless, fast and intuitive.
Common standards for design and delivery of government services and
information will make interacting and transacting with government easier
for everyone.

There are good examples of government digital services, but there is
room for improvement. Inconsistent look, feel and function of services
and information makes things confusing for users. The new standard
underpins a 'digital by design' approach - designing with digital
delivery as the focus and removing unnecessary hangovers from
paper-based systems. Services will be built around user needs.

The standard will be supported by a Digital Service Design Guide to
provide practical guidance to agencies on how to meet the standard. The
Guide will be developed with agencies and released progressively over
the next few months.

We will be talking about the standard, what it means and how to apply it
over the next few months in a range of forums. To get involved in the
conversation and to find out about future events join the:

Digital Transformation Plan 
===========================

Supporting agencies to transform their service delivery

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is supporting agencies in
planning their transformation to provide users with a better experience
when dealing with government. The DTO has established a network of
[Digital Transformation
Coordinators](/standard/digital-transformation-plan/digital-transformation-coordinators)
(DTCs) that supports each agency in the development of a Digital
Transformation Plan and progress of services through digital
transformation.

Digital Transformation Plan
---------------------------

All non-corporate Commonwealth agencies (most former *Financial
Management Accountability Act 1997* agencies) with high volume
transaction services (that is, 50,000 transactions per annum) [in scope
of the Standard](/standard/scope-digital-service-standard) are required
to develop and publish a Digital Transformation Plan.

The Digital Transformation Plan enables agencies to be transparent about
their planned transformation activities and report on their progress
against the [Digital Transformation Agenda](/budget). 

### Scope

Your plan should explain the current service offerings and the user
needs to be met, the vision for the agency, and how it will get there.

-   **Where we are now**
    -   service users and their requirements; how the agency engages
        with its users around service delivery, and detail of current
        services
    -   strategic context and direction for the agency and its digital
        transformation, including current initiatives to digitise
        services.
-   **The future**: the vision for the digitally transformed agency.
-   **How we will get there**
    -   identification of specific aspects of services that can be
        transformed quickly and enable significant improvements to the
        user experience
    -   identification, prioritisation and planning the transformation
        of high volume transactional services to comply with the
        [Digital Service Standard](/standard)
    -   an action plan that addresses the changes required at the
        organisational, cultural and capability levels.

### Preparing your plan

The DTO will make available a secure online tool, to assist agencies in
preparing and submitting their plan, progressively from the start of
August. The DTO will manage access to the tool via [Digital
Transformation
Coordinators](/standard/digital-transformation-plan/digital-transformation-coordinators)
and other nominated persons at each agency.

The online planning tool will allow a draft plan to be saved and
completed over several weeks. It will generate an agency executive
summary for approval and provide data for reporting service
transformation on the DTO dashboard. The transformation planning process
is being supported through workshops and guidance from the DTO. You can
keep an eye on our regular [blog updates](/blog) and contact your DTC
for more information.

Agencies with high volume transactional services must submit plans to
the DTO by September 2015.  

### Reporting progress

Agencies are required to report progress against their plan. This
information will automatically populate a whole-of-government reporting
dashboard.

Agency plans will be reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or as
required. This reflects alignment with the Digital Transformation Agenda
and changes to agency service delivery.

Transformation phases
---------------------

Transformation planning will be different for every agency, however
agencies are expected to address 4 key areas:

-   Agency preparation
-   Agency capability
-   Transformation implementation
-   Evaluation and assessment.

### Agency preparation

An agency needs to plan to transform its overall approach to service
delivery, and how its high volume transactional services will be
transformed. Agencies should consider the adoption of common platforms
and joined-up services across government could accelerate their
transformation without duplicating effort or investing in non-aligned
initiatives.

Key elements in planning agency transformation include:

-   Leadership and culture – is it strong, well placed, does it need
    attention?
-   Level of digital engagement with users
-   Portfolio and organisational management – governance, structure
-   Compliance and processes; for example, processes to check the
    service aligns with [Digital Service Standard](/standard)
-   Service delivery partnerships; for example, with third parties
-   Digital capabilities; including people, information and technology
-   Service delivery contestability – is there a way to redesign the
    service in a way that is commercially contestable?

Agencies must prioritise the services that need to transform first and
consider the common platforms and solutions they will adopt in line with
the criteria set out in the Digital Service Standard. Considerations for
prioritising include:

-   identifying high volume transaction services where digital
    improvements will benefit a lot of users
-   opportunity to do a short, sharp piece of work to transform a user
    service (or important aspects of it)
-   user services where a high proportion of potential users are already
    online, providing opportunities to rapidly achieve high digital
    take-up
-   breaks in contract provision, where a significant change offers an
    opportunity for a reappraisal of what is delivered and how
-   services currently perceived as problematic or ‘failing’, where a
    transformational re-design will reduce user frustration or lead to
    savings through operational efficiencies
-   ‘greenfield’ opportunities to introduce new digital services
-   opportunities across departments to provide more holistic,
    integrated, streamlined and connected services to users.

### Agency capability

Agencies need enterprise-wide service level capability to support
digital transformation. This involves:

-   having the digital skills and capability to build services that are
    simple and easy to use
-   addressing potential barriers to going digital (such as legislative,
    technical, infrastructure, service complexity, and so on)
-   catering for the needs of people who require [assisted
    digital](/design-guides/guide/assisted-digital) support
-   plans to integrate non-digital services with digital ones.

### Transformation implementation

Agencies need to use an integrated approach, based on user needs, to
build internal capability as well as services. Agencies should translate
user needs into services that are simple and intuitive enough so that
users succeed digitally, first time, every time. The [digital service
design principles](/standard/design-principles) should underpin agency
implementation.

### Evaluation and assessment

Evaluating the progress of the organisation and its service
transformation is crucial. A dashboard will support a
whole-of-government view of agency progress in the digitisation and
transformation of high volume services. Given the early stages for
digital transformation within Australian Government, guidance on this
phase will continue to be refined.

Some questions to consider include:

-   Has the agency increased its digital capability?
-   What is the agency’s capability to engage with users and undertake
    user-centred design, including prototyping and user testing?
-   Do service delivery staff have the appropriate knowledge and skills
    as well as access to the digital transformation process?
-   Does the service comply with the [Digital Service
    Standard](/standard/)?
-   Does the new service meet the key needs of the user and address
    user-engagement trends?
-   What proportion of the service is now digital?
-   What is the level of sophistication of the digital aspects of your
    services?
-   Does the digital service integrate seamlessly?

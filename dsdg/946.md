New services for individuals {#page-title .page__title .title}
============================

The Government is committed to continuing to improve and expand the
myGov service.

The myGov service currently has more than 6.5 million active accounts,
with the number of new accounts growing by approximately 15 000 each
day. It provides access to secure digital services from multiple
government agencies, and more services will become available over the
coming 12 months.

Digital Mailbox
---------------

The current myGov digital mail service commenced operation in March
2014.  The service has delivered more than 45 million letters to
Centrelink, Medicare, and Child Support customers since commencement of
service. The Australian Taxation Office commenced using the service in
March 2015.

This initiative will see the service connected to more agencies and
allow Australians to receive and transact with more and more messages
from government in one place, in a seamless, secure, and authenticated
environment.

Tell Us Once
------------

The current myGov Tell Us Once solution will be enhanced and made
available to more agencies over the coming months.

The solution enables the millions of Australians that change their
contact details every year to update their information in myGov and have
this sent to myGov linked agencies, rather than having to do it through
a variety of digital, face-to-face or telephony channels.

The ability to update details in one place and have one login will save
Australians time and money.

Voice authentication
--------------------

The Government is establishing a better voice biometric authentication
solution to make it quicker and easier for Australians to access
telephony and mobile service delivery channels.

The solution will leverage work underway within the Department of Human
Services and the Australian Taxation Office, and make it much easier for
individuals to access secure services through government call centres or
mobile devices.

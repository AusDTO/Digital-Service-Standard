**Our challenge: How do we get the right information and services to
people when and where they need it?**

The public relies on Government for a broad range of information –
advice for individuals and businesses, what services are available and
how to access them, and how various rules and laws impact our lives.

The government’s digital environment has grown organically over the last
couple of decades. At the moment, information is largely created and
managed within agencies and published across more than 1200 disparate
gov.au websites, plus a range of social media accounts, apps and other
digital formats.

This creates some difficulties for people looking for government
information. By publishing within agency silos we are presenting people
with an agency-centric view of government information. This is a problem
because people largely don’t understand or care about how government
organises itself and the structure of government does not map to the
needs of people. Having a baby or travelling overseas? Up to a dozen
government agencies may have information relevant to you. And as
people’s needs span more than one agency, they end up with a disjointed
and confusing user experience as they have to navigate across disparate
government sites. And even if you begin at your favourite search engine
how do you know which of the many government search results is the right
place to start?

There are two government entry points already in place to help users –
Australia.gov.au and business.gov.au – but they largely act as an
umbrella across the 1200+ sites and currently only provide a very thin
layer of whole of government information and mainly refer people off to
other websites.

The establishment of the DTO has provided the first opportunity for
people to come together and better understand how our underlying
structural landscape is impacting people’s experience with government.
It’s also given us an opportunity to take a step back and ask some of
the big questions about how we manage information and what problems can
only really be solved through whole of government transformation.

How do we make information and services easier to find? How do we make
sure we provide information that people can trust and rely upon at times
of need? How should the gov.au landscape be organised to make it easier
for us to meet user’s needs and expectations? How many websites should
we have – assuming 1200 is too many? What makes up a better user
experience – does it mean all sites should look and feel the same? How
can we provide government information at the places people naturally go
looking for assistance – even if these are not government sites?

As we asked these questions we started to come across some central
ideas:

-   What if we could decouple the authoring and management of
    information from the publishing process, so the subject experts in
    government still manage their content but we have flexibility to
    present it in more user-centric ways?
-   What if we unleashed government information? Making it possible for
    state and local governments, non-profit groups and businesses to
    deliver content and services alongside their own information to give
    better value users.
-   Should we move the bureaucratic content (information about agencies
    and how they are managed such as annual reports, budget statements
    and operating rules) out of the way of core content and services for
    people? Can we simplify our environment and base it around topics
    and life events instead of agencies? What if we had people in
    government responsible for curating these topics and life events
    across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?

We think one of the most important things government can do to drive
change is make our information and services consumable – across agencies
and by non-government organisations. We want to move to an API-enabled
publishing model, where authoritative content is created once, managed
by experts, but can be published in many places. This will help
government do a better job of focussing around people’s needs, but also
opens up government information to third parties who can innovate and
create new opportunities and value for users.

We also think that there is an underlying cultural change that needs to
happen across government to make this work, a breaking down of some
embedded processes and reaching out across agency and jurisdiction
borders.

Over the coming months we will be using an evidence-based design
approach to flesh these ideas out – using prototypes to test with end
users and consulting with agencies and other sectors. From this we will
build a whole of government strategy to transform the way we provide
government information to the public.

**What do you think?**

It’s going to take some work to get this right – please tell us what you
think of our ideas so far. Have we asked the right questions? Are we
taking the right approaches? How do we prioritise this work?

What is being done to address the quality of government information
presented on websites? Making information and services easier to find is
a great goal. It doesn't help much though if once you find the right
information, the information itself is poorly written, complicated,
poorly structured and presented, full of jargon, out of date -
essentially difficult to understand. It is also unlikely that others
will want to consume bad content (no matter how good the APIs are).

Yes, completely agree. We think this needs a variety of approaches.

We are planning to create and implement a whole of government content
model because this will help subject matter experts understand what they
should include and how to structure their content depending on what they
are writing about. It would make content across government more
consistent in how it is constructed and presented.

We think creating Chief Editors against each topic (rather than site)
this would go some way to getting rid of conflicting, inaccurate or out
of date information. Conflicting information is amplified by multiple
agencies/sites writing on the same topic but from a slightly different
angle. We also understand the difficulties of reusing content from
somewhere else when it's a cut and paste at a given point in time. We
think consuming content via API in real time will make it easier to keep
the information current and give the owner of that content more
assurance that people are reusing the latest version.

As for poorly written content or use of jargon we will be implementing a
'plain English' assessment tool. At the moment we are testing a couple
of tools and getting a better understanding of how they work. The intent
is that we will regularly run a tool across all publically available
content and then report on the results through the DTO Dashboard. The
Digital Service Standard strongly supports plain English and provides
guidance and support that should help web teams to insist on those
standards within their agencies.

We are very open to more ideas on what else needs to happen to make
government content better and easier to understand. What would you like
to see happen?

I think creating Chief Editors is a good idea: most government agencies
are large publishers, but they may not recognise or acknowledge this
part of their business. Would a Chief Editor oversee the process from
commissioning to publishing? That might assist agencies follow the
appropriate processes to produce their content digital first (as opposed
to thinking only of print).

Hi Bobby,

I'd expect an editorial role to span the full range of activities from
commissioning to publishing.  I think especially in larger agencies a
Chief Editor could never be only the only person putting forward ideas
for new content or identifying gaps but maybe they would own the process
- and through that process they could ensure digital first. 

We have some great examples in the APS of high quality content being
produced by agencies that have given their Editors the authority to
oversee the process and the quality for their agency content.  We are
very keen to learn from them and hear from others so we can propose
something that will work.

Hi Sharyn - this discussion about Chief Editors is particularly
interesting to me as I'm delivering a presentation to the Society of
Editors on what it means to be an editor in the digital age. I give you
a mention! - and look forward to working with you to deliver better
content.\

That would be great!  Let me know if the Editors are keen to debate the
Chief Editor idea and tell us how they would design a role I could
create a blog topic around this so have their say and we could all
learn.

Consider the pros and cons of centralised vs decentralised publishing.
The role of a chief editor is different for each of these models.

Some really good intial thinking here. No doubt a massive challenge, but
a worthwhile one. I think the issue about publishing within inter-agency
silos runs deeper, as many agencies have intra-agency silos. These silos
are often based around user categorisations (eg, market segments) that
are developed by the agency itself, and often don't translate to the
realities of the external users world. The agency website often mirrors
those categorisations, creating inherent design floors and usability
issues for the user. Whether the driver for these silos is about
control, politics or other, it's one of the cultural traits that will
need to be broken down for these concepts to gain momemtum.

Thanks Justin,

I agree with your observations on silos.  It's a hard one to crack
because I bet most people don't go to work wanting to perpetuate their
silos.  I reckon it's mostly an unintended consequence of breaking work
into manageable chunks (ie teams) that then gets made worse the busier
you are.

Chief Editors are one possible way to help deliver more holistic content
to users but we know we need to go further and look at the cultural
drivers that support (or undermine) being able to work across  silos and
deliver what people need.  So what are the values and behaviours we need
to reward...or stop rewarding?

What would you like to change if you had the opportunity?

Hi Sharyn

I agree Chief Editors would be a valuable resource, as long as each
agency is committed to providing the editors with an appropriate level
of authority to avoid them being perceived as blockers creating
bottlenecks. This needs to be coupled with a strategic approach to
information creation and delivery designed at the whole-of-government
level that each agency is working towards (covering both content and
delivery).

At the moment, I see an imbalance between the authority of subject
matter experts and comms/publishing staff in many agencies. Things are
slowly changing, but in my experience, the subject matter experts will
win the argument on whether something gets published or not 8 or 9 times
out of 10. This has led to the proliferation of "low value" duplicated,
overly technical content bogging down government websites.

One of the biggest problems I think we face culturally is this tendancy
to encourage/reward "input" as a measure of success (eg, "we created "x"
amount of content to support our clients"). This measure is often used
to prove to management "how busy we are", "how productive we've been",
"why I should get that promotion". There isn't a whole lot of emphasis
placed on measuring/rewarding the effectiveness of our work, how we did
we reduce complexity, how did remove an irritant, how did we improve a
service etc. The "so what" question.

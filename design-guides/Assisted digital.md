<h1>Assisted digital</h1>
Assist users to interact and transact with government digitally, and provide alternatives for those who can’t.<p>A whole-of-government assisted digital strategy will ensure that assisted digital support is delivered consistently across government services and is a priority for all new and enhanced digital services.</p>
<p>All agencies with <a href="http://www.dto.gov.au/standard/scope-digital-service-standard">services in scope</a> will need to outline their plan for providing digital assistance as part of their <a href="http://www.dto.gov.au/standard/digital-transformation-plan">Digital Transformation Plan</a>.</p>
<p>As this guide evolves it will outline the circumstances in which a person may require assistance with digital interactions and the ways that this may be provided.</p>
<h2>Why must I?</h2>
<p><a href="http://lpaweb-static.s3.amazonaws.com/Coalition%27s%20Policy%20for%20E-Government%20and%20the%20Digital%20Economy.pdf" target="_blank" title="Exiting DTO website">The Coalition’s Policy for E-Government and the Digital Economy (PDF 1.18 MB)</a> designates the Internet as the default way for government to interact with users, other than for defined exceptions. These defined exceptions may be an inability to interact digitally due to location, disability, language, or digital literacy.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing the digital and assisted digital routes to a digital service" title="diagram showing that most users can access digital services but some users will need assistance" height="423" width="858"  src="http://www.dto.gov.au/sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/assist_dig_0.png?itok=-dy2ORDw" /></p>
<p>People who need help to interact digitally will be assisted to use digital channels. Those unable to will be provided with the support through appropriate channels such as shop-fronts, telephone, video or authorised representatives.</p>
<h2>How do I?</h2>
<ul><li><a href="#identifyAD">Identify assisted digital users</a></li>
<li><a href="#identifyAR">Identify assistance required</a></li>
<li><a href="#makesureusers">Make sure users know where to get help</a></li>
</ul><h3><a id="identifyAD" name="identifyAD"></a>Identify assisted digital users</h3>
<p class="lead-in">Assisted digital services will focus primarily on 3 key groups:</p>
<ul><li>those who will get there but require a little encouragement</li>
<li>those who are almost there but need some assistance</li>
<li>those who can’t get there and will need ongoing support.</li>
</ul><p>Every service will have different mixes of assisted digital users. During the <a href="http://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-process#discoverdefine">Discover and Define phase</a> you need to develop an understanding of how many of your current non-digital users need assisted digital support and learn what their needs are.</p>
<h3><a id="identifyAR" name="identifyAR"></a>Identify assistance required</h3>
<p class="lead-in">Assisted digital support can be delivered in many ways, including:</p>
<ul><li>online, with access to appropriate support</li>
<li>over the telephone, with someone guiding the user through the service or inputting information into a system on their behalf</li>
<li>in person, at a service centre</li>
<li>via video conferencing (from a shopfront or from the users' location)</li>
<li>through an authorised representative of the person assisting or acting on their behalf.</li>
</ul><h3><a id="makesureusers" name="makesureusers"></a>Make sure users know where to get help</h3>
<p>Ensure non-digital users can access the help they need to use the service.</p>
<p>This support is required to help non-digital users. However, it should not be heavily promoted beyond the target users as the intent is to encourage most people to interact digitally and independently. </p>

<p>The public relies on Government for a broad range of information – advice for individuals and businesses, what services are available and how to access them, and how various rules and laws impact our lives.</p>
<p>The government’s digital environment has grown organically over the last couple of decades. At the moment, information is largely created and managed within agencies and published across more than 1200 disparate gov.au websites, plus a range of social media accounts, apps and other digital formats.</p>
<p>This creates some difficulties for people looking for government information. By publishing within agency silos we are presenting people with an agency-centric view of government information. This is a problem because people largely don’t understand or care about how government organises itself and the structure of government does not map to the needs of people. Having a baby or travelling overseas? Up to a dozen government agencies may have information relevant to you. And as people’s needs span more than one agency, they end up with a disjointed and confusing user experience as they have to navigate across disparate government sites. And even if you begin at your favourite search engine how do you know which of the many government search results is the right place to start?</p>
<p>There are two government entry points already in place to help users – Australia.gov.au and business.gov.au – but they largely act as an umbrella across the 1200+ sites and currently only provide a very thin layer of whole of government information and mainly refer people off to other websites.</p>
<p>The establishment of the DTO has provided the first opportunity for people to come together and better understand how our underlying structural landscape is impacting people’s experience with government. It’s also given us an opportunity to take a step back and ask some of the big questions about how we manage information and what problems can only really be solved through whole of government transformation.</p>
<p>How do we make information and services easier to find? How do we make sure we provide information that people can trust and rely upon at times of need? How should the gov.au landscape be organised to make it easier for us to meet user’s needs and expectations? How many websites should we have – assuming 1200 is too many? What makes up a better user experience – does it mean all sites should look and feel the same? How can we provide government information at the places people naturally go looking for assistance – even if these are not government sites?</p>
<p>As we asked these questions we started to come across some central ideas:</p>
<ul><li>What if we could decouple the authoring and management of information from the publishing process, so the subject experts in government still manage their content but we have flexibility to present it in more user-centric ways?</li>
<li>What if we unleashed government information? Making it possible for state and local governments, non-profit groups and businesses to deliver content and services alongside their own information to give better value users.</li>
<li>Should we move the bureaucratic content (information about agencies and how they are managed such as annual reports, budget statements and operating rules) out of the way of core content and services for people? Can we simplify our environment and base it around topics and life events instead of agencies? What if we had people in government responsible for curating these topics and life events across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?</li>
</ul><p>We think one of the most important things government can do to drive change is make our information and services consumable – across agencies and by non-government organisations. We want to move to an API-enabled publishing model, where authoritative content is created once, managed by experts, but can be published in many places. This will help government do a better job of focussing around people’s needs, but also opens up government information to third parties who can innovate and create new opportunities and value for users.</p>
<p>We also think that there is an underlying cultural change that needs to happen across government to make this work, a breaking down of some embedded processes and reaching out across agency and jurisdiction borders.</p>
<p>Over the coming months we will be using an evidence-based design approach to flesh these ideas out – using prototypes to test with end users and consulting with agencies and other sectors. From this we will build a whole of government strategy to transform the way we provide government information to the public.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>It’s going to take some work to get this right – please tell us what you think of our ideas so far. Have we asked the right questions? Are we taking the right approaches? How do we prioritise this work?</p>

  <span rel="sioc:reply_of" resource="/blog/transforming-government-information" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span><div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-inline clearfix"><div class="field-label">Comment:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Great to see government digital content management and curation moving ahead under the new DTO. I agree it is a big challenge but vital if we are to become user/customer-centric and deliver a positive digital government experience.  I&#039;m keen for the user/customer perspective to be part of the DTO&#039;s thinking as early as possible. Some CX thoughts on the big questions highlighted in Sharyn&#039;s blog:  </p>
<p>Question 1:  What would user/customer centric ways of presenting government information look like?</p>
<p>The government information user/customer wants two things: the quickest way to the content they need, and, of course, the right content to satisfy their need.  The best government user/customer experience will feature:</p>
<p>Top search results (whether through external or government search engines) that leave you in no doubt as to where to go to access the   content.  This will be supported by effective whole of government web analytics, SEO techniques and API-enablement.<br />
AND<br />
Quality content that:<br />
•	carries government commitment that it is the best source.  It is complete, correct and up to date, and can be relied on<br />
•	provides a pleasurable digital experience – eg easy to navigate, white space, no pdfs, smart forms<br />
•	can be shared, downloaded, and copied easily<br />
•	is easy to understand and interpret – eg infographics, plain English, audio/video<br />
•	is concise, yet complete and up to date.  It has layers for deeper detail, if you want this<br />
•	is smart – it knows when it isn’t satisfying you and provides virtual, automated and human channels to assist you<br />
•	is available in open access formats, if you need them</p>
<p>Question 2:  Will it help our users/customers if we unleash government information? Making it possible for state and local governments, non-profit groups and businesses to deliver content and services alongside their own information to give better value to users. How would we do this in a user/customer centric way?</p>
<p>Giving users/customers access to government information has the potential to make government more credible and build even better service delivery models through NFP and private sector disruption/innovation.  “Unleashing” government information without a vision built on user/customer needs and genuinely involving them in the design upfront is likely to result in poor user/customer experiences, and lead to reduced credibility of government. Government content can be published by any layer of government, by the NFP and the private sector with access.  A key question is who can provide the best user/customer experience and digital standards.  This could be the public, NFP or private sector.</p>
<p>Question 3:  Will it help our customers if we remove the bureaucratic content (information about agencies and how they are managed such as annual reports, budget statements and operating rules) out of the way of core content and services for people? </p>
<p>I think we compromise a healthy user/customer centric approach if we categorise annual reports, budgets and operating rules as bureaucratic information.  There are many users and customers who want to know that government is being managed well. They want quick, easy access to this information in the same way that another user/customer might want BOM forecasts or information about social services.</p>
<p>Good governance, and demonstrating transparency about what government is doing, are “core content” for government.  This is similar to  core governance content requirements for companies in Australia (and in many overseas jurisdictions). Public companies publish corporate governance content such as annual reports, governance charters and policies on their websites to give the market assurance and meet ASX/corporate law requirements.  Government should continue to categorise  its good governance documentation as &#039;core&#039; content. A healthy government wants to assure its users/customers that it is credible and can be trusted, and that ultimately, government is accountable to its citizens.  </p>
<p>Question 4: Will it help the customer to simplify our environment if we base content around topics and life events instead of agencies? </p>
<p>As a user/customer, my view would be yes in most cases but it will vary from customer to customer.  For example, business customers already align their processes strongly along agency lines in the regulatory and compliance space e.g. agencies such as Department of Agriculture for cargo import assessments, ATO for taxation matters, ASIC for company regulation and ACCC for competition matters. This is also the case for private citizens eg Department of Human Services, DIBP and BOM. Outside in thinking and early customer/user engagement across business, NFPs and private citizens will be critical pre-POC and establishing the priorities. </p>
<p>On setting priority topics, the US Government Digital Analytics Program is showing that immigration, weather and tax returns figure among the mostly widely accessed topics by government information users (<a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">https://analytics.usa.gov/</a>). This is an open source project with the website and its data free to use without restriction. Transparent website data of this nature (preferably analysed across all layers of Australian government) will help with setting our content design priorities. Giving open access will also help build Australian government credibility, and support the efforts of other sectors in delivering government services and content.</p>
<p>Question 5: Will decoupling the authoring and management of information from the publishing process help our users/customers, so the subject experts in government still manage their content but we have flexibility to present it in more user-centric ways? </p>
<p>The more efficient way is to make sure content is authored by subject matter experts (SMEs) and content specialists who are equipped (skills, culture and motivation) to work together to deliver content that has the user/customer foremost in mind.  Our digital government solutions involve the whole government team – especially our government subject matter experts, not just our increasingly-savvy digital customer interface.  It would be a constant ‘work around’ to convert unsuitable SME content to more suitable user-centric formats.  And our goal of transforming to customer-centric digital service delivery will be constantly challenged by disconnects and artificial demarcations within the government design and delivery team.</p>
<p>Question 6: What if we had people in government responsible for curating these topics and life events across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?</p>
<p>Small, agile cross-agency (and also cross-government layer) teams with responsibility for content curation on allocated topics across all sites (and other digital channels) could lead to better, more consistent content.  The concept of Chief Editors against each topic is a good one. We can&#039;t overlook the value of cross-sectoral teams if we are serious about content being cross-sectoral channels. Let&#039;s pull in the experience and expertise of other sectors early, and most importantly, design and build the Australian government&#039;s approach to content management from the outside in - from the user/customer perspective.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to provide such a thorough response!  I'm going to respond to each of your points separately starting with</p>
<p>Question 1</p>
<p>Absolutely agree and I hope you will be heartened that these are the principles that are guiding us.  We are doing a big piece of work on <a href="../news-media/blog/building-better-services-analytics.html">analytics</a> and another on SEO.   We are covering all the elements you identified as critical to building a great user experience.  We've identified 'Anticipating user needs' as another. </p>
<p>Question 2</p>
<p>Good questions for us to consider.  I stress that we don't intend - that making it easy for others to reuse content and access to services - would mean government doesn't need to care about designing for users or can stop providing websites and services directly.  These ideas came from a starting point of "Why must people <strong>always</strong><strong> </strong>come to a Government online space to get what they need?  "Why can't other people and groups also deliver that content especially to places where users are naturally located online?  For example: in the case of pregnancy I'm likely to go to a Essential Baby or a babycenter.com as soon as I know I'm pregnant to access due date calculators etc.  That could be months before I go to a government site to seek services around becoming a parent.  Can this provide opportunities to let people know early what services are available to them?</p>
<p>Question 3</p>
<p>Yes tricky balance I think.  We don't want to compromise good governance and transparency (or democracy).  We understand there is an audience who needs easy access to this type of content.  However, we are seeing far too many examples of corporate content (particularly that which describes what we are doing as an agency to meet government objectives) getting in the way of a person trying to do something with government.  We can link to supporting information (policy, legislation, strategy) so it's easy to find on any given user pathway to action. Is that enough or not enough?</p>
<p>I think this is subject that deserves a good robust debate and needs a lot of people to participate.  We are likely to have a future blog just on this one topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Thought you might like this graphic, particularly as you&#039;re talking about prioritization.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/co-creation-of-government-services">http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/co-creation-of-government-services</a><br />
It really is the hardest thing for anyone working in a public&#039;s service, inside a departmental silo. One knows that so much of the need here is to design personalized services, and they can&#039;t be designed unless the citizen-centric approach is addressed, and we have forums where insiders and outsiders can work together. </p>
<p>The idea of Chief (topic) editors is a natural one. The GOV.UK guys (e.g.) have taken the first step in that they share the same publishing app (for Central gov departments). You might be aware that, as the UK only has two levels of gov institutions, the talk over there is about creating another publishing site for all Local govs. And there&#039;s a lot of resistance to it. </p>
<p>That said, there has been some discussion about &quot;topical teams&quot; (over on the OK Open Policy Makers blog &amp; LI group). This is where the teams/groups are placed at the moment. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups">https://www.gov.uk/government/groups</a>, and the topics are kept here. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics">https://www.gov.uk/government/topics</a>  </p>
<p>And just so you don&#039;t think this is just the way a few national transformation teams think, check out slides 14 and 15 of this presentation at the EU a few years ago. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/do-we-have-an-eu-online-public-space">http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/do-we-have-an-eu-online-public-space</a> &quot;National conversations on a specialist topic&quot; (or service) appear even more daunting when you take the perspective across 27 countries. </p>
<p>So where does one start? Seems like you&#039;re asking the same questions every librarian asked themselves over a decade ago. &quot;What if we had people in government responsible for curating these topics and life events across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?&quot; </p>
<p>It&#039;s almost impossible to see a solution from &quot;a media&quot; perspective unless, as any rational mind will, one thinks about how to firm up &quot;a directory for specialist groups&quot;, and then running to supporting online forums where users (inside and outside different gov departments) go to ask, and answer, topical questions (FAQs). e.g. <a href="http://www.oclc.org/questionpoint.en.html">http://www.oclc.org/questionpoint.en.html</a></p>
<p>But the key to this problem, it seems, is because we DO only think in terms of &quot;government&quot;, where a governing institution&#039;s role is to &quot;deliver&quot;. We just can&#039;t make it to the point where we see that we&#039;re talking about citizens - gov employees and their &quot;consumers&quot; - are sharing services (applications) on a common public inter-network. The only illustration I can give you here, to illustrate the difference between your &#039;publishing/web&#039; perspective and that of the people who are creating the more open inter-operation between departmental silos/networks is this. <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/networking/19/314">http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/networking/19/314</a></p>
<p>The networking perspective doesn&#039;t look at departmental publishing in the first instance. It looks at (putting the user in the centre of everything) and letting them choose which gov (or private) institution they trust the most to store their personal details/data (and provide their basic IDA attributes).  </p>
<p>You ask &quot;What would you like to see happen?&quot;. In the first instance, it would be good to see/reveal the specialist groups who span across the Department of Communication&#039;s &quot;portfolio agencies&quot;. <a href="https://www.communications.gov.au/">https://www.communications.gov.au/</a> , including the DTO. We do need some leadership here and learning by doing is the best way. (Not that you need to be told :) All the best.</p>

<p>A unified approach cannot help but impact negatively on usability because you&#039;re trying to combine content from different agencies...<br />
with different audiences... and different focuses or types of content. Usability and content requirements for an octogenarian trying to find out if there&#039;s been a recall on their electric blanket would be massively different to that of a consumer advocacy lawyer.</p>
<p>Also combining content from different agencies poses a huge number of information architecture issues in itself... that&#039;s if you&#039;re lucky that the advice of differently agencies isn&#039;t actually contradictory on a topic.</p>
<p>Agencies frequently disagree, that&#039;s part of the checks and balances that is our government. How are information curators, moving between agencies, going to work. Information is the currency of any agency and given heavy investment required in producing resources there would have to be a strong mandate for them to be willing to relinquish their control at the point of publication.</p>
<p>We&#039;re assuming 1200 sites is too many. Is it? Is that just an assumption because 1200 sounds like a big number? It would be a lot of jellybeans in a jar but probably about the right amount of bees in a hive. Would more actually be better?</p>
<p>How do we get the right information and services to people when and where they need it? Do we know that is isn&#039;t?</p>
<p>Is the information silo-ed or is this a reflection of the mosaic of content and audiences that has their needs met by digital services? By reducing the scope of those services are we providing better services... or just less? Does the information need to be unleashed or actually pruned and reduced, and fix the bugs in the systems that already exist rather than creating new systems with their own set of problems?</p>
<p>Could what you&#039;re talking about with providing experience based content not be achieved by creating audience or experience based sites that link to agency resources, on the agency&#039;s site. (link to the source, single source of truth?)</p>
<p>We hope this has been helpful.</p>

<p>1200+ sites is clearly way too many - but the argument around not being able to use a more consistent and consolidated design &quot;approach&quot; is complete hogwash. Agencies are too precious about their &quot;brands&quot;. What&#039;s being discussed here is greater consistency, less duplication, and less bouncing around from site to site. It doesn&#039;t mean 1 website, and it doesn&#039;t mean everything has to look the same.</p>
<p>And then, don&#039;t even get me started on how much it is costing government to run all these different sites on all the different platforms they currently use. Reducing the number of sites is good for end users, and its good for agency budgets too.</p>
<p>Im really excited to see what you and the team come up with Sharyn.</p>

<p>Something else to thing about is how does government decouple organisation structure from content structure.</p>
<p>The majority of government websites are structured around their (current, or recently past) organisational structure.</p>
<p>These organisational structures are designed to segment work in a functional way to deliver it cost-effectively, but rarely reflect the external view of the organisation, or how citizens/customers/stakeholders interact with information supplied by that organisation.</p>
<p>In fact organising public facing information based on an organisational operating structure is often one of the least effective ways to share it.</p>
<p>Care needs to be taken around the &#039;Chief Editor&#039; model to ensure that it doesn&#039;t fall into the same trap of being designed around the internal operational structure and is actively designed to reflect the most efficient method of sharing information.</p>
<p>BTW - A key indicator that a government organisation isn&#039;t thinking about its users is placing the &#039;About us&#039; tab at top left in the main page menu - a &#039;high vis&#039; position compared to the far right or a header/footer menu (ie dss.gov.au). Fortunately the DTO places &#039;About&#039; at far right on its menu, so there&#039;s hope!</p>

Create topics on a few websites that stand the test of time and change more slowly than the structure of government. Give &quot;Chief editors&quot; accountability for a topic NOT an agency.</p>
<p>Move all the corporate guff, accountability and transparency information to a single place - lets call it about.gov.au</p>
<p>Take total control over the .gov.au domain name space. Refuse to issue new vanity domains for &quot;marketing purposes&quot;.</p>
<p>Make agencies publish analytics data about the performance of their site(s) and their total cost.</p>
<p>Employ some *actual* designers to work on the visual design of sites. Employ *actual* content professionals and give them the editorial power they need. Stop creating things just because some Minister wants it to satisfy their vanity. If there is no user need for a thing, there is no need to do the thing in the first place.</p>

<p>I think the content is there, but scattered across the 1200 websites you have suggested. My thoughts are there is disconnection between content developers and people who deliver and work with the community.<br />
I think what we need to look at is working with agencies on the ground who understand the community (which includes business). One of the other major issue is the digital divide. People who have knowledge about the services which can be accessed online are using it but there is a vast majority of people who have no idea how to access and utilize the services. I think it is time Federal, State and Local governments come together to educate and engage with the community to make them understand of the services being provided online/digitally. It is also important to work with various agencies e.g. community based and not-for-profits so that they actively update the links to various government websites. Also content developers have to understand that some processes cannot be done online because of risk factors and other privacy legislations. This is a major factor because I have seen developers giving solutions to departments on the basis that one day everything will be online.<br />
On the point of the looks of the website, I think it will be good if everything looks same and the navigations gets easier and also helps in educating the community.</p>

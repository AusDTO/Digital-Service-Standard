User research
=============

Understanding user needs, expectations, preferences and experiences

Conducting user research is a key part of designing a good user experience. User research helps you to better understand your users: their needs, expectations, preferences and experiences. This enables you to objectively inform the design and delivery of services, as well as evaluate their success.

Carry out user research during every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage; don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of [service design phases](../../node/service_design_process.md).

Doing ongoing user research will help your team to:

-   concentrate on real user needs
-   design products which are prioritised by user needs
-   iterate products in response to user feedback
-   design products that are valued by its users
-   provide [inclusive services](../../node/inclusive_services.md) that are accessible to all users (meeting accessibility requirements).

There are a many methods and techniques that can be used in user research. Selecting the right approach depends on:

-   your research objectives
-   the [design phase](../../node/service_design_process.md#phases) you’re in
-   available time, budget and people.

Why must I?
-----------

All best practice approaches to [user-centred design](../../user_centred_design.md) recommend gaining a deep understanding of users to design and deliver a good user experience. User research informs the early stages of design and development. This means regular iteration or continuous improvement, based on user research carried out throughout the [service design process](../../node/service_design_process.md), ensures that users’ needs remain a key focus and are accurately reflected in in the final solution.

We want to deliver government services that are easy to find, simple to use, convenient and [accessible](../../node/making_content_accessible.md) for all in a safe and secure way. Having services that people actually want and use will, in turn, increase the value and efficiency of government service delivery.

How do I?
---------

Identify your business objectives to uncover what the problem is and the reason for needing user research. Clarify your objectives with stakeholders by thinking about benefits and risks. The statement of the problem and research objectives guides the entire research process.

### Define objectives

Define what needs to be researched to meet the business objectives. The following questions can be useful to ask yourself before you start:

-   What are the knowledge gaps you need to fill?
-   What are your assumptions?
-   What do you believe you already know about your users?

You should also explore whether there is existing data, information or research that you can draw on. This could include web, channel or application statistics, complaints data, website and social media feedback, correspondence to and from ministers, and media commentary.

Your research questions will affect the type of research you’ll need to conduct. The axes of Christian Rohrer’s[A landscape of user research methods diagram](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/) are a useful way to understand commonly used user-research methods:

-   **Qualitative vs. quantitative**: qualitative methods tend to focus on the richness of findings and are better suited for answering questions about ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ to fix a problem. Quantitative methods tend to focus on the statistical validity of findings and are better for answering ‘how many?’ and ‘how much?’ questions.
-   **Attitudinal vs. behavioural**: what people ‘say’ versus what people ‘do’, which can often be different.

In addition, you should consider the **context of use**: how and whether participants in the research are using the product or service in question.

### Plan research approach

Once your objectives are developed, consider what approach best suits the type of information you need to collect. The methods you select will depend on your research objectives, user groups, the design phase you are in as well as the time, budget and people you have.

If you have limited time and resources, even interviews with your own customer-facing staff can give you good insights into user needs. If you have more time and resources, a combination of methods is usually best.

The following table summarises the typical research objectives and lists the predominant approaches and typical methods associated with each design phase.

### Conduct research

As part of working out your approach, you need to identify your target user groups and their characteristics, and if you are planning to use face-to-face techniques, how you will recruit them.  Consider the diversity of your users, including differing abilities, Indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds to ensure you design [inclusive services](../../node/inclusive_services.md).

You also need to work out where and when you are doing the research and who will actually conduct the research.

Generally speaking, most user research methods can be conducted without the need for an in-house expert or specialist external provider. The principle behind all user research methods is to identify and understand users’ experience at a human level. However there are some [professional research techniques](../../node/professional_research_methods.md) that do require a level of expertise to conduct.

It is also useful to think about others who could observe the research. Having service sponsors and managers observe research sessions is very powerful as it allows them to hear directly from users.

Once you have worked out your objectives and approach, it is good to summarise these into a brief research plan that you can share and test with others.

The approach that you use will determine how you capture information, how your research questions are answered and whether you prove or disprove your hypotheses. It is important to consider the needs of those around you in making your findings as useful and usable as possible. It may be necessary to develop a detailed usability report. Alternatively, developing a high level summary could be sufficient to give the key findings to design teams and more broadly to get the most benefit from your research.

Guidance for agencies on recruitment of digital, technology and specialist skills

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will progressively provide guidance, support and advice to agencies on the recruitment of digital, technological and specialist roles. This support is not intended to replace existing human resources and recruitment processes but will help develop a common skillset for digital service delivery across the Australian Public Service (APS).

Why must I?
-----------

The Government has a commitment to deliver government services digitally from start to finish to better serve the needs of citizens and businesses. Building great digital services and supporting technology requires strong leadership and a wide array of skills. Not all agencies have access to the skills and experience that will allow them to confidently and successfully deliver digital services.

How do I?
---------

-   [Determine skills required](../../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#determine)
-   [Identify skills available in your agency](../../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#identify)
-   [Review recruitment and selection guidelines](../../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#selection)
-   [Recruit the right skills](../../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#recruit)

### Determine skills required

Agencies should identify the skills and experience required to deliver their digital services. Many of the skills needed to lead and deliver these services are relatively new to government and are highly sought after. More guidance is available on [the team](../../foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md).

### Identify skills available in your agency

Agencies should ensure that the required skills are available to them. In most cases these will be a combination of in-house and/or outsourced resources.

Knowledge gaps within agencies can be addressed by training existing staff, recruiting new staff, outsourcing resources or a combination of these approaches.

These gaps also present agencies with an opportunity to develop skills in-house; see if there are team members who can be trained for new roles. Also, consider secondments or temporary movements between agencies to address the skills gaps and provide opportunities for knowledge and skills transfer.

### Review recruitment and selection guidelines

Recruitment policies and guidelines for the APS are the responsibility of the [Australian Public Service Commission](http://www.apsc.gov.au/) (APSC) and are subject to change. Your agency's human resources team will assist you to follow the current APSC and agency policies when undertaking a recruitment process.

### Recruit the right skills

When you are considering an individual or company to work with, they should give you evidence of:

-   their knowledge and understanding of industry and government standards and policies including [WCAG2.0](http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/wcag-2-implementation/) and [Government 2.0](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/gov20/)
-   their proven track record of digital delivery
-   how they will use continuous delivery methods
-   how they will share knowledge and provide coaching and mentoring to agency staff who are developing and/or will be responsible for the service
-   how they select and use an appropriate delivery method while working with areas using different delivery methodologies; for example, Agile Scrum or PRINCE2
-   their commitment and capability to work on-site to share knowledge
-   how they will deliver user-centred quality to the process.

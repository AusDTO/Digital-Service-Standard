Affinity diagramming
====================

Making sense of unstructured user research

Affinity diagramming is an activity that to allows you to quickly analyse large quantities of unstructured qualitative information into clear themes and relationships. It is commonly used by design teams with deep knowledge to analyse their field notes from contextual enquires, or qualitative information captured in surveys. But this activity can be conducted with any information.

Prepare materials
-----------------

Write a single key piece of information on a single post-it note. Post-it notes are preferred as their size forces you to be concise; if there are large quantities of typed information you can print and cut it into single points). Place the post-its on a large wall or walls. Have some larger different coloured post-it notes on hand to create group headings when you are ready.

If you have dot stickers, it can be helpful to assign different coloured dot to different sources of information. This will help you to keep track of your information sources and allow you to see patterns.

Gather the team
---------------

You need 3 people at a minimum to ensure thinking is unbiased. These people should be familiar enough with the information that the post-its make sense to them without needing further explanation.

Start the activity in silence to ensure that team members don’t influence each other. Place all the post-it notes onto the wall and start grouping them together in similar themes. At this stage do not add headings to the wall. The idea is to keep moving post-its until clear groups form. It doesn’t matter if team members move post-its placed by other team members.

Once clear groupings have emerged, gather together and create headings using your different coloured post-its. If needed, you can break a large grouping into smaller themes (using the same process).

Using your findings
-------------------

How you make use of your findings is dependant on your specific needs. Individuals who participated in the activity will have a deep understanding of the content and the common themes so sometimes the groupings will answer what the team needs to know.

If you need to go outside of the team you may wish to produce a report explaining key research findings and back it up with significant points from the post-its. If you do this it’s worthwhile to bring stakeholders and sponsors into the space to see the quantity of information and the themes that have emerged. Of course, if possible, it’s better to get them involved upfront as part of the sorting process.

Common government content and features
======================================

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is currently considering how common content and features can be adopted across Australian Government websites to make them easier for people to use. This might include common approaches to branding, navigation, content style, page layout and features. Any new guidance will be prioritised around improving the user experience, particularly for interactions that involve more than single agencies or tiers of government.

The DTO is also considering how the publishing of all information about government operations can be improved to make it easier for agencies to meet their obligations, and to provide a consolidated view of this information for people who are interested.

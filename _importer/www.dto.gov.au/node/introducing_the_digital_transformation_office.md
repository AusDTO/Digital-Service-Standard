Hi I'm David Hazlehurst. I'm the acting CEO of the government's new Digital Transformation Office.

The DTO has been created to lead a new approach to the government delivering information and services to Australians. 

We know that Australians expect the same kind of easy interaction that they get when they're doing their online banking or shopping on their mobile device when they deal with government. We also know that people don't want to be smothered with forms or have to queue up in a government office to interact with government. So we'll be working across government to drive a relentless focus on the needs of the user. 

We will be taking an agile and open approach to the way in which services and information are developed. We'll be seeking your ideas about what's most important to people and what should be done first. We'll be sharing our ideas early and openly and seeking feedback and when we actually deploy services and put information out there we'll be iterating that information and those services to improve them in response to feedback. We also want to create an ecosystem in which the best ideas, methods and the best people from the private sector can be blended with the best of the public sector in order to deliver great results for the public.

To make a start today we're going live and releasing an alpha version of the new digital service standard. The standard will set out the criteria that all Australian government services and information will need to meet to ensure they're easier to find and easier to interact with. From the middle of 2015 all government agencies will need to ensure that services and information that they are developing or improving, comply with the standard. Most importantly the standard will put the needs of the user first. Releasing the standard in this way, in an Alpha form and seeking feedback, is a reflection of the new approach we want to take. 

Getting the input from the public and from experts out there in the community including overseas on the best way in which these services can be delivered. So if you're interested follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ausdto). Get engaged through [our website](../foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) and stay tuned for bigger announcements from Malcolm Turnbull the Minister for Communications.

David Hazlehurst
Acting CEO

Very Impressive. Looks like this will be outcome and mterics driven. Not sure how all this can be accomplished by 2017 though unless some specific services are targeted as the GDS, UK has done.

Hi David. I can't seem to find comments published anywhere on the DTO Blog even though we are invited to comment. I would have thought the launch of the DTO would have generated some comments. I also can't find your blog moderation policy anywhere. Regards James

Hi David,

It's good to hear from you, but what's more critical is hearing from the teams doing the work to develop services and information. There's plenty of people 'out here' (beyond the public service) with experience and ideas - so don't fall into old-school methods of thinking, such as working in a bubble and then exposing your ideas for 'feedback' when its too late to cheaply change direction, or contracting Big 4 consultants to tell you what to do, then finding it doesn't work in practice.

Instead involve the community in every stage of the process in a codesign/cocreation approach so you're not having to go back and reengineer solutions because public servants were unaware of some advanced technology or approach. Too many government agencies are afraid to engage external communities early, or to talk about their work with people outside the public sector. This leads to far too many unnecessary failures, embarrassment, loss of respect and the premature end of many otherwise well intended initiatives.

Right now I'm cautiously hopeful about the DTO's ability to break the mold and create solutions of lasting value. However every day your blog is silent, every week your office is unable to talk about the specifics of what you're doing and every month you don't invite experts and the community to work actively with your team on a cooperative basis to deliver the best solutions for public problems (and yes, improving government efficiency and effectiveness is a social challenge, not just a public sector one), you will lose momentum and credibility amongst the communities best able to support you. Don't give us 'big announcements from the Minister for Communication' - give us daily announcements from team members at the front line of service redesign and an ongoing sustained conversation where every assumption is tested and every public sector norm is challenged.

Thanks and good luck in breaking out of a 19th century organisational mold to leverage the power of highly educated and experienced individuals - both within and outside the public service.

PS - and fix your blog commenting mechanism so that it correctly presents paragraphs - otherwise all the comments will be hard to read!

Cannot agree more! Please conduct relevant and regular consultations with the experts of the new world technology right from the beginning of any digital project.

Comment: 

It's a small point, but an important one to remember - the Australian Government, at a Federal level, doesn't deliver many services. Once you've knocked off Centrelink, Medicare and the ATO for citizens, and Business.gov.au for companies, everything else is a rounding error. Digital services are mostly a State and Local government problem. Sure, the DTO will find some loose ends to tidy up - but at the federal level, the job is mostly done.

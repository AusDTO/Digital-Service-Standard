Social media
============

How and when to use social media

Social media provides unique opportunities to engage with users and other stakeholders on a personal level. It also enables agencies to access a much wider audience than traditional communication methods. It can be a very powerful tool to get feedback on early ideas, concepts and prototypes for digital services.

This guide will evolve over the coming months. If you would like specific guidance on something please [let us know](../engage.md).

Why must I?
-----------

It is not a mandatory requirement to use social media. However, it can enable you to leverage the views and experience of your users to improve the service from very early in design.

### Understand social media activities

It is important to understand the different ways social media is used before you decide on which channels to use.

-   **Communication** – getting your message out, or alerts, building a public narrative, setting the public record. For example, [Queensland Police Service’s disaster management (PDF 601 KB)](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/corporatedocs/reportsPublications/other/Documents/QPSSocialMediaCaseStudy.pdf), the [Australian Bureau of Statistics Census Spotlight](http://www.finance.gov.au/collaboration-services-skills/australian-government-ict-awards-program/excellence-in-egovernment-winners-finalist/).
-   **Consultation** – getting public feedback on something. For example, public Sphere and legislative consultations like [Pittsburgh Open Data Legislation wiki](https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/draft-legislation-wiki).
-   **Co-development and crowdsourcing** – developing something with or collecting information from citizens. For example, [Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/) and GovHack.
-   **Service support** – directly supporting citizens online. For example, the [Department of Human Services connecting with clients via social media](case_study_connecting_with_users_on_social_media.md).

A [short guide and resources for using social media](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2013/07/10/online-engagement-courses-%E2%80%93-final-report/) has been developed to provide advice to support the Australian Public Service.

### Develop an engagement strategy

Your engagement strategy should cover:

-   what you’re trying to achieve and what success looks like
-   who your audience is, where they are, how to reach them, and what they can (broadly) contribute
-   which are the best one-to-many tools for your audience: for example, Twitter will be useful in raising awareness of your engagement activities but may not be appropriate for seeking in-depth feedback
-   if you have a team with the right skills
-   how to be as transparent and open as possible, so users know they are being listened to
-   how you will understand the perspective of your users and work to improve their experience
-   how you will adopt an iterative approach to build upon learnings and ensure meaningful outcomes
-   how you will recognise the contributions of individuals (internal and external)
-   how to maintain a strong social media presence over time.

### Keep your knowledge current

Social media is never static; it is continually evolving. The [APS tools for online engagement](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2013/07/10/online-engagement-courses-%E2%80%93-final-report/) provide some guidance on various platforms available. This is not an 'authorised' list, and new tools are released every year. Make sure you keep exploring and trying out things. Every platform has inherent strengths and weakness that should be well understood before committing resources.

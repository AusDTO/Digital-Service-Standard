Common website elements
=======================

Content and elements that must be included on every government website

There are common content items and site features that must be included on every Australian Government website. These requirements help users to access content and ensure public accountability information is provided consistently.

How do I?
---------

The Digital Transformation Office is currently consulting on how [common government content and features](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) can be adopted across Australian Government websites to make them easier for people to use.

Australian Government websites must:

-   manage [ministerial content](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   meet the [Online Content Requirements](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   identify the agency
-   provide contact details
-   provide a website disclaimer
-   use uniform navigation
-   assess privacy impacts of [cookies](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   comply with the [Caretaker Conventions](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) during election periods
-   use correct [metadata](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   use appropriate [content licensing](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   provide a copyright notice
-   use open licensing where possible.

There are specific requirements for agencies about how to [refer correctly to the Australian Government in content](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#refercorrectly).

The primary websites of Australian Government agencies must also:

-   meet additional [Online Content Requirements](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   publish details of individual grants
-   make all forms digitally available
-   publish media releases and speeches
-   publish non-commercial agency publications
-   meet the requirements of the [FOI Act and Information Publication Scheme](../design-guides/subguides/foi-act-and-information-publication-scheme/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) including providing a disclosure log
-   list [contracts](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md)
-   provide [files list (Harradine report)](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md).

One of the things people ask us here at the DTO, is “have you spoken to…?” Well, we are speaking to as many people as we can, with experience and ideas from all levels of government and the private sector.

This month, amongst many others, we spoke with Allan Henn, Lisa Asquith and Dennis van Rooyen from NSW’s [OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/).

[OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/) takes a whole-of-government approach to transaction services that moves beyond departmental silos. Since its launch, the small but agile team at [OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/) has replaced 46 old and unconnected systems with one platform and now supports agencies from most NSW departments.

Citizens can access [OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/) 24/7 across multiple channels including via smart phones, over counters, on the internet, IVR, sales agents and kiosks.

Recent mobile services such as a ‘[Look up a Tradie’](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/PublicRegister/#/publicregister/search/Trades)register and the ability to renew licences using your mobile phone have seen the service attract over 2000 customers each day with no promotion of the service. They also manage the administration of 125 licences from boat and liquor licences to security licences. Lisa told us that, already, there is 99% public satisfaction with mobile services.

Interestingly the [OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/) platform also operates as a white label, behind-the-scenes product, enabling about 350 types of services for [Service NSW](http://www.service.nsw.gov.au/) who are rolling out one-stop shops through NSW, and improving access through call centres and a single website for the public.

The NSW Government has reduced the number of government websites from around 8,000 to 400.

Implementing whole-of-government change is challenging. Under Allan’s guidance, the [OneGov](https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/new/) team has developed a lot of experience in managing that complexity. But, says Allan, it’s made worthwhile by the positive public feedback, improvements in agency efficiency, cutting red tape and the professionalism of the team as it constantly innovates to achieve results.

Lessons learnt for the DTO
--------------------------

What the DTO took away from this meeting was:

-   The importance of the user satisfaction approach, basically the customer is the focus
-   Website and shopfront consolidation can occur
-   121 user transaction services run on one backend for \$12M per year done with 50 largely business and technology people
-   Enabled and enabling API systems
-   Taking a responsive web approach to mobile with APIs so private sector can do app development (wholesaling government)
-   Being able to leverage the data centre and tech marketplace for play and prototyping
-   Having a mandate is not enough, have to demonstrate value
-   Use data to drive decision making
-   Shared platforms or shopfronts can leverage from each other
-   Design the user journey from end to end
-   Automate what you can.

What do you think?
------------------

OneGov shows state agencies can work together to provide great seamless services to the public. Can Federal agencies? Can Federal, State and Local agencies work together to achieve the same? Can you share examples of where this is happening now? What issues have you encountered and how did you overcome them?

Great work and a perfect example of the opportunity to rethink the legacy infrastructure that bedevils so much progress across all Governments.
 But I'm pretty sure that while NSW had quite a few websites it was a number closer to 800, not 8,000!

That was good.

Although I would have used the byline of "Peers (in one gov) working with Peers (in another gov)". Nice to see that we can give credit where credit is due. Congats to Allan, Lisa, Dennis and rest of the NSW teams.

It's always a bit funny when one gov uses the url "Onegov". There are so many of them. Always gets one wondering, which one a citizen is supposed to start from? Hopefully we can expect to see a report like this from all the other State and Territory Onegovs.

I guess the one, and trickiest, question to all of them, including the DTO, is how do they design "the user journey end to end" when they are all designing for the same person? That's the 64 million dollar question over in the UK, where, now that they have GOV.UK as a common publishing point for central gov departments, they are trying to figure out where to include the 400-odd Local govs in the url. And they only have two levels of publisher.gov.

Just checking the "Current Status of the (NSW) programme". <https://www.onegov.nsw.gov.au/New/about-gls>
 And comparing the Aussie approach to the UK, where licenses are called permissions. <https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/13/lets-talk-about-permissions/>

It's interesting that, in the UK, their GaaP team have noticed that " users need to act as a government go-between to get permission for the activity they need to do". They also notice that "Users who haven’t done that activity before often find themselves in a position where they don’t know if they need permission to do something or which permissions they might need, from where".

Hopefully, that's an (shared) education which each OneGov.au will provide to each of their common users.

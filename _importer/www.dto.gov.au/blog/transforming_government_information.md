**Our challenge: How do we get the right information and services to people when and where they need it?**

The public relies on Government for a broad range of information – advice for individuals and businesses, what services are available and how to access them, and how various rules and laws impact our lives.

The government’s digital environment has grown organically over the last couple of decades. At the moment, information is largely created and managed within agencies and published across more than 1200 disparate gov.au websites, plus a range of social media accounts, apps and other digital formats.

This creates some difficulties for people looking for government information. By publishing within agency silos we are presenting people with an agency-centric view of government information. This is a problem because people largely don’t understand or care about how government organises itself and the structure of government does not map to the needs of people. Having a baby or travelling overseas? Up to a dozen government agencies may have information relevant to you. And as people’s needs span more than one agency, they end up with a disjointed and confusing user experience as they have to navigate across disparate government sites. And even if you begin at your favourite search engine how do you know which of the many government search results is the right place to start?

There are two government entry points already in place to help users – Australia.gov.au and business.gov.au – but they largely act as an umbrella across the 1200+ sites and currently only provide a very thin layer of whole of government information and mainly refer people off to other websites.

The establishment of the DTO has provided the first opportunity for people to come together and better understand how our underlying structural landscape is impacting people’s experience with government. It’s also given us an opportunity to take a step back and ask some of the big questions about how we manage information and what problems can only really be solved through whole of government transformation.

How do we make information and services easier to find? How do we make sure we provide information that people can trust and rely upon at times of need? How should the gov.au landscape be organised to make it easier for us to meet user’s needs and expectations? How many websites should we have – assuming 1200 is too many? What makes up a better user experience – does it mean all sites should look and feel the same? How can we provide government information at the places people naturally go looking for assistance – even if these are not government sites?

As we asked these questions we started to come across some central ideas:

-   What if we could decouple the authoring and management of information from the publishing process, so the subject experts in government still manage their content but we have flexibility to present it in more user-centric ways?
-   What if we unleashed government information? Making it possible for state and local governments, non-profit groups and businesses to deliver content and services alongside their own information to give better value users.
-   Should we move the bureaucratic content (information about agencies and how they are managed such as annual reports, budget statements and operating rules) out of the way of core content and services for people? Can we simplify our environment and base it around topics and life events instead of agencies? What if we had people in government responsible for curating these topics and life events across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?

We think one of the most important things government can do to drive change is make our information and services consumable – across agencies and by non-government organisations. We want to move to an API-enabled publishing model, where authoritative content is created once, managed by experts, but can be published in many places. This will help government do a better job of focussing around people’s needs, but also opens up government information to third parties who can innovate and create new opportunities and value for users.

We also think that there is an underlying cultural change that needs to happen across government to make this work, a breaking down of some embedded processes and reaching out across agency and jurisdiction borders.

Over the coming months we will be using an evidence-based design approach to flesh these ideas out – using prototypes to test with end users and consulting with agencies and other sectors. From this we will build a whole of government strategy to transform the way we provide government information to the public.

**What do you think?**

It’s going to take some work to get this right – please tell us what you think of our ideas so far. Have we asked the right questions? Are we taking the right approaches? How do we prioritise this work?

What is being done to address the quality of government information presented on websites? Making information and services easier to find is a great goal. It doesn't help much though if once you find the right information, the information itself is poorly written, complicated, poorly structured and presented, full of jargon, out of date - essentially difficult to understand. It is also unlikely that others will want to consume bad content (no matter how good the APIs are).

Yes, completely agree. We think this needs a variety of approaches.

We are planning to create and implement a whole of government content model because this will help subject matter experts understand what they should include and how to structure their content depending on what they are writing about. It would make content across government more consistent in how it is constructed and presented.

We think creating Chief Editors against each topic (rather than site) this would go some way to getting rid of conflicting, inaccurate or out of date information. Conflicting information is amplified by multiple agencies/sites writing on the same topic but from a slightly different angle. We also understand the difficulties of reusing content from somewhere else when it's a cut and paste at a given point in time. We think consuming content via API in real time will make it easier to keep the information current and give the owner of that content more assurance that people are reusing the latest version.

As for poorly written content or use of jargon we will be implementing a 'plain English' assessment tool. At the moment we are testing a couple of tools and getting a better understanding of how they work. The intent is that we will regularly run a tool across all publically available content and then report on the results through the DTO Dashboard. The Digital Service Standard strongly supports plain English and provides guidance and support that should help web teams to insist on those standards within their agencies.

We are very open to more ideas on what else needs to happen to make government content better and easier to understand. What would you like to see happen?

I think creating Chief Editors is a good idea: most government agencies are large publishers, but they may not recognise or acknowledge this part of their business. Would a Chief Editor oversee the process from commissioning to publishing? That might assist agencies follow the appropriate processes to produce their content digital first (as opposed to thinking only of print).

Hi Bobby,

I'd expect an editorial role to span the full range of activities from commissioning to publishing.  I think especially in larger agencies a Chief Editor could never be only the only person putting forward ideas for new content or identifying gaps but maybe they would own the process - and through that process they could ensure digital first. 

We have some great examples in the APS of high quality content being produced by agencies that have given their Editors the authority to oversee the process and the quality for their agency content.  We are very keen to learn from them and hear from others so we can propose something that will work.

Hi Sharyn - this discussion about Chief Editors is particularly interesting to me as I'm delivering a presentation to the Society of Editors on what it means to be an editor in the digital age. I give you a mention! - and look forward to working with you to deliver better content.

Consider the pros and cons of centralised vs decentralised publishing. The role of a chief editor is different for each of these models.

Some really good intial thinking here. No doubt a massive challenge, but a worthwhile one. I think the issue about publishing within inter-agency silos runs deeper, as many agencies have intra-agency silos. These silos are often based around user categorisations (eg, market segments) that are developed by the agency itself, and often don't translate to the realities of the external users world. The agency website often mirrors those categorisations, creating inherent design floors and usability issues for the user. Whether the driver for these silos is about control, politics or other, it's one of the cultural traits that will need to be broken down for these concepts to gain momemtum.

Thanks Justin,

I agree with your observations on silos.  It's a hard one to crack because I bet most people don't go to work wanting to perpetuate their silos.  I reckon it's mostly an unintended consequence of breaking work into manageable chunks (ie teams) that then gets made worse the busier you are.

Chief Editors are one possible way to help deliver more holistic content to users but we know we need to go further and look at the cultural drivers that support (or undermine) being able to work across  silos and deliver what people need.  So what are the values and behaviours we need to reward...or stop rewarding?

What would you like to change if you had the opportunity?

Hi Sharyn

I agree Chief Editors would be a valuable resource, as long as each agency is committed to providing the editors with an appropriate level of authority to avoid them being perceived as blockers creating bottlenecks. This needs to be coupled with a strategic approach to information creation and delivery designed at the whole-of-government level that each agency is working towards (covering both content and delivery).

At the moment, I see an imbalance between the authority of subject matter experts and comms/publishing staff in many agencies. Things are slowly changing, but in my experience, the subject matter experts will win the argument on whether something gets published or not 8 or 9 times out of 10. This has led to the proliferation of "low value" duplicated, overly technical content bogging down government websites.

One of the biggest problems I think we face culturally is this tendancy to encourage/reward "input" as a measure of success (eg, "we created "x" amount of content to support our clients"). This measure is often used to prove to management "how busy we are", "how productive we've been", "why I should get that promotion". There isn't a whole lot of emphasis placed on measuring/rewarding the effectiveness of our work, how we did we reduce complexity, how did remove an irritant, how did we improve a service etc. The "so what" question.

Hi Sharyn,

Thought you might like this graphic, particularly as you're talking about prioritization.
 <http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/co-creation-of-government-services>
 It really is the hardest thing for anyone working in a public's service, inside a departmental silo. One knows that so much of the need here is to design personalized services, and they can't be designed unless the citizen-centric approach is addressed, and we have forums where insiders and outsiders can work together.

The idea of Chief (topic) editors is a natural one. The GOV.UK guys (e.g.) have taken the first step in that they share the same publishing app (for Central gov departments). You might be aware that, as the UK only has two levels of gov institutions, the talk over there is about creating another publishing site for all Local govs. And there's a lot of resistance to it.

That said, there has been some discussion about "topical teams" (over on the OK Open Policy Makers blog & LI group). This is where the teams/groups are placed at the moment. <https://www.gov.uk/government/groups>, and the topics are kept here. <https://www.gov.uk/government/topics>

And just so you don't think this is just the way a few national transformation teams think, check out slides 14 and 15 of this presentation at the EU a few years ago. <http://www.slideshare.net/mathew.lowry/do-we-have-an-eu-online-public-space> "National conversations on a specialist topic" (or service) appear even more daunting when you take the perspective across 27 countries.

So where does one start? Seems like you're asking the same questions every librarian asked themselves over a decade ago. "What if we had people in government responsible for curating these topics and life events across agencies and creating simpler pathways for users?"

It's almost impossible to see a solution from "a media" perspective unless, as any rational mind will, one thinks about how to firm up "a directory for specialist groups", and then running to supporting online forums where users (inside and outside different gov departments) go to ask, and answer, topical questions (FAQs). e.g. <http://www.oclc.org/questionpoint.en.html>

But the key to this problem, it seems, is because we DO only think in terms of "government", where a governing institution's role is to "deliver". We just can't make it to the point where we see that we're talking about citizens - gov employees and their "consumers" - are sharing services (applications) on a common public inter-network. The only illustration I can give you here, to illustrate the difference between your 'publishing/web' perspective and that of the people who are creating the more open inter-operation between departmental silos/networks is this. <http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/networking/19/314>

The networking perspective doesn't look at departmental publishing in the first instance. It looks at (putting the user in the centre of everything) and letting them choose which gov (or private) institution they trust the most to store their personal details/data (and provide their basic IDA attributes).

You ask "What would you like to see happen?". In the first instance, it would be good to see/reveal the specialist groups who span across the Department of Communication's "portfolio agencies". <https://www.communications.gov.au/> , including the DTO. We do need some leadership here and learning by doing is the best way. (Not that you need to be told :) All the best.

Comment: 

A collection of thoughts from myself and my colleagues.

A unified approach cannot help but impact negatively on usability because you're trying to combine content from different agencies...
 with different audiences... and different focuses or types of content. Usability and content requirements for an octogenarian trying to find out if there's been a recall on their electric blanket would be massively different to that of a consumer advocacy lawyer.

Also combining content from different agencies poses a huge number of information architecture issues in itself... that's if you're lucky that the advice of differently agencies isn't actually contradictory on a topic.

Agencies frequently disagree, that's part of the checks and balances that is our government. How are information curators, moving between agencies, going to work. Information is the currency of any agency and given heavy investment required in producing resources there would have to be a strong mandate for them to be willing to relinquish their control at the point of publication.

We're assuming 1200 sites is too many. Is it? Is that just an assumption because 1200 sounds like a big number? It would be a lot of jellybeans in a jar but probably about the right amount of bees in a hive. Would more actually be better?

How do we get the right information and services to people when and where they need it? Do we know that is isn't?

Is the information silo-ed or is this a reflection of the mosaic of content and audiences that has their needs met by digital services? By reducing the scope of those services are we providing better services... or just less? Does the information need to be unleashed or actually pruned and reduced, and fix the bugs in the systems that already exist rather than creating new systems with their own set of problems?

Could what you're talking about with providing experience based content not be achieved by creating audience or experience based sites that link to agency resources, on the agency's site. (link to the source, single source of truth?)

We hope this has been helpful.

Comment: 

If agencies disagree, then how can the average person looking for government information pick their way through numerous sites? How can they be sure what they're looking at is the authoritative version or the most up-to-date?

1200+ sites is clearly way too many - but the argument around not being able to use a more consistent and consolidated design "approach" is complete hogwash. Agencies are too precious about their "brands". What's being discussed here is greater consistency, less duplication, and less bouncing around from site to site. It doesn't mean 1 website, and it doesn't mean everything has to look the same.

And then, don't even get me started on how much it is costing government to run all these different sites on all the different platforms they currently use. Reducing the number of sites is good for end users, and its good for agency budgets too.

Im really excited to see what you and the team come up with Sharyn.

Hi Sharyn,

Something else to thing about is how does government decouple organisation structure from content structure.

The majority of government websites are structured around their (current, or recently past) organisational structure.

These organisational structures are designed to segment work in a functional way to deliver it cost-effectively, but rarely reflect the external view of the organisation, or how citizens/customers/stakeholders interact with information supplied by that organisation.

In fact organising public facing information based on an organisational operating structure is often one of the least effective ways to share it.

Care needs to be taken around the 'Chief Editor' model to ensure that it doesn't fall into the same trap of being designed around the internal operational structure and is actively designed to reflect the most efficient method of sharing information.

BTW - A key indicator that a government organisation isn't thinking about its users is placing the 'About us' tab at top left in the main page menu - a 'high vis' position compared to the far right or a header/footer menu (ie dss.gov.au). Fortunately the DTO places 'About' at far right on its menu, so there's hope!

Get rid of all the agency-specific websites. Create topics on a few websites that stand the test of time and change more slowly than the structure of government. Give "Chief editors" accountability for a topic NOT an agency.

Move all the corporate guff, accountability and transparency information to a single place - lets call it about.gov.au

Take total control over the .gov.au domain name space. Refuse to issue new vanity domains for "marketing purposes".

Make agencies publish analytics data about the performance of their site(s) and their total cost.

Employ some \*actual\* designers to work on the visual design of sites. Employ \*actual\* content professionals and give them the editorial power they need. Stop creating things just because some Minister wants it to satisfy their vanity. If there is no user need for a thing, there is no need to do the thing in the first place.

Hi Sharyn,

I think the content is there, but scattered across the 1200 websites you have suggested. My thoughts are there is disconnection between content developers and people who deliver and work with the community.
 I think what we need to look at is working with agencies on the ground who understand the community (which includes business). One of the other major issue is the digital divide. People who have knowledge about the services which can be accessed online are using it but there is a vast majority of people who have no idea how to access and utilize the services. I think it is time Federal, State and Local governments come together to educate and engage with the community to make them understand of the services being provided online/digitally. It is also important to work with various agencies e.g. community based and not-for-profits so that they actively update the links to various government websites. Also content developers have to understand that some processes cannot be done online because of risk factors and other privacy legislations. This is a major factor because I have seen developers giving solutions to departments on the basis that one day everything will be online.
 On the point of the looks of the website, I think it will be good if everything looks same and the navigations gets easier and also helps in educating the community.

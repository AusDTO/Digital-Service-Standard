<p>Meeting Australian Government requirements on records management and content access</p>

<p>All government services, in particular government websites, contain and generate records. These records are subject to legislative and regulatory records management requirements. This guide provides advice on processes you can follow to ensure that you meet these requirements.</p>

<p><strong><img src="../../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/importanticon.png%3Fitok=icqOt7eD" alt="" />Legislative requirements</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under Section 24 of the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796"><em>Archives Act 1983</em></a>, Australian Government agencies must retain records for designated periods in accordance with records authorities issued by the National Archives of Australia (NAA). The Archives Act also establishes that the public generally has a right of access to Australian Government records over a certain age.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562"><em>Freedom of Information Act 1982</em></a> provides a legally enforceable right of access by individuals to government-held documents, other than exempt records.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/"><em>Evidence Act 1995</em></a> requires that all agencies take account of evidence legislation. A court may need to examine records as evidence of an organisation’s decisions and actions.</li>

<h3 id="assign-responsibilities">Assign responsibilities</h3>

<p>To comply with Australian Government requirements and ensure efficient delivery of your service, you should assign roles and responsibilities for records management within your team.</p>

<p>Depending on the tasks required, you could assign responsibilities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a particular individual or staff position (for example, content author or website administrator)</li>
  <li>a particular work group</li>
  <li>all members of your team.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure accountability you must document roles and responsibilities in your agency’s records management policy (or other information governance documentation) and/or in position descriptions. Further <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/Images/archweb_guide_tcm16-47165.pdf">guidance on assigning responsibilities (PDF 200 KB)</a> is available from the NAA.</p>

<h3 id="capture-content">Capture content</h3>

<p>Content generated, captured or received using web technologies must be kept as evidence of business activities and decision making for as long as it is required. You need to ensure this is captured in your agency’s electronic records management system or in a business system. You should use the <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/digital/iso-16175/index.aspx">ISO 16175:2011 Principles and Functional Requirements for Records in Electronic Office Environments</a> standard to determine whether the CMS or business system has adequate records management functionality.</p>

<p>Ways to capture web content</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configure your agency’s web content management system (CMS) to systematically capture content</li>
  <li>Link your CMS with your agency’s electronic records management system to automatically capture content</li>
  <li>Capture content/pages manually in the agency electronic records management system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Captured content should be described using the <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/create-capture-describe/describe/agls.aspx">AGLS metadata standard</a> to improve the visibility and accessibility of your website and other web-based content. The NAA provides AGLS metadata services to <a href="http://www.agls.gov.au/validator">validate existing metadata properties</a> and <a href="http://www.agls.gov.au/generator">generate new metadata properties</a>.</p>

<h3 id="manage-content-for-ongoing-access">Manage content for ongoing access</h3>

<p>Web content, like all other agency records, needs to be accessible for as long as it is required. You have an obligation to ensure web content is findable and usable and that any private or sensitive information it contains is protected from misuse or unauthorised access. </p>

<p>You can support the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/strategy-and-governance/gov2/declaration-of-open-government.html">Australian Government’s commitment to open access to information</a> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring the access provisions of the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796"><em>Archives Act 1983</em></a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/"><em>Freedom of Information Act 1982</em></a> and the legal obligations under the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712"><em>Privacy Act 1988</em></a> are met</li>
  <li>using meaningful <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/create-capture-describe/describe/agls.aspx">AGLS metadata</a> terms to describe and track web content</li>
  <li>capturing web content into systems with adequate records management functionality</li>
  <li>protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of web content preserving web content so it remains accessible over time, for the approved retention period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strategies to improve access to content</p>

<ul>
  <li>Track changes to the content over time and create a log of changes or activity. The activity log needs to be captured and maintained in the agency electronic records management system</li>
  <li>Capture information exchanged online between an individual or business and your agency in a system/database with appropriate records management functionality or the agency electronic records management system</li>
  <li>Implement website maintenance processes to ensure the content on your agency website remains accurate and current</li>
  <li>Address the interoperability of services so that information can be exchanged and re-used in a uniform and efficient manner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/access/access-to-records-in-your-agency.aspx">describing and preserving web content</a> and <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/Images/archweb_guide_tcm16-47165.pdf">managing web content (PDF 200 KB)</a> is available from the NAA.</p>

<h3 id="store-content">Store content</h3>

<p>Web content must be kept in an accessible form for legally specified periods of time.  </p>

<p>Best-practice recommendations for storage</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan for technology obsolescence and ensure content can be copied, reformatted or migrated; these preservation actions need to be documented in the system metadata</li>
  <li>Maintain content in widely accepted technology-neutral storage and data interchange formats; where appropriate, you should store content in two different formats</li>
  <li>Decide whether to keep content on an offline or online storage medium by considering the storage space (snapshots of sites and activity logs use large amounts of storage space) and speed of access</li>
  <li>Implement security measures to protect content against deliberate or accidental alteration or destruction</li>
  <li>Conduct regular checks to monitor the functionality and integrity of content.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dispose-of-content-when-no-longer-needed">Dispose of content when no longer needed</h3>

<p>The length of time that web content must be retained is determined by the classes in your agency’s records authority or in <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/keep-destroy-transfer/general-records-authorities/index.aspx">general records authorities</a>. The records authorities are legal instruments issued by the NAA that set up requirements for keeping, destroying or transferring Australian Government records.</p>

<p>If there is a need to retain the material for an extended time, and it is not eligible for transfer to the NAA, you will need to put in place preservation strategies to make sure the information being kept will remain accessible in future even after multiple changes to hardware and software.</p>

<p>Disposal involves the destruction of records, as well as the transfer of records either to another agency or to the NAA.</p>

<p>Your agency can destroy web content when all of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate retention period has expired</li>
  <li>material is no longer needed for business use</li>
  <li>material is not affected by a <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/keep-destroy-transfer/freezes/index.aspx">records disposal freeze</a>.</li>
</ul>

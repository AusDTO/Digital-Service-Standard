<h1 id="user-pathways">User pathways</h1>

<p>Documenting the steps of user interactions</p>

<p>User pathways are a design tool used to visually document the logical step-by-step process of a user’s interactions with a product or service.</p>

<p>User pathways enable you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop a common understanding with stakeholders of the current <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user experience</a> and interaction points before designing the future solution</li>
  <li>manage and map the change between current and future <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user experience</a> from people, process and technology perspectives</li>
  <li>uncover issues early in the <a href="../../node/service_design_process.md">design process</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>A user pathway should show each step a user would go through in the sequence of using the product or service. It should clearly show a user’s touch points with the system. This can highlight pain points with a current state, and what will change in a future state.</p>

<p>The purpose is to understand all the people, process and technology interactions needed to make a change. This uncovers issues that need to be resolved, and ensures that we understand what is required to be done, by who and by when.</p>

<h2 id="conduct-research">Conduct research</h2>

<p>User pathways have to be developed collaboratively with stakeholders and ideally are informed and verified with user input or research. Ask subject matter experts and business areas for information and documents on the systems or products that are scoped into the change.</p>

<h2 id="develop-initial-draft">Develop initial draft</h2>

<p>Read and start to step out a current state user process at a very high level, this should be simple steps phrased as actions. Don’t make assumptions: if you are unsure of a step or have a question, call it out to check with stakeholders later. This initial draft will be the starting point to present to stakeholders and build a more informed pathway.</p>

<p>Typically user pathways are documents as flow charts, with different swimlanes for each actor (for example, user, agency and so on). Using a flow chart style helps you to piece together the pieces of the puzzle by asking questions about ‘What’s next?’ and ‘How did that get there?’.</p>

<h2 id="test-draft-with-stakeholders">Test draft with stakeholders</h2>

<p>Gather stakeholders in a <a href="../../node/workshops.md">workshop</a>to test the initial current state pathway. Be prepared to make amendments to the pathway right up to the end of the workshop.</p>

<p>Keep the process steps at a consistent level of detail. Try not to get side tracked documenting the low-level actions unless you’re aiming for a very detailed pathway. Remember the focus of a user pathway is the user!</p>

<p>After confirming the current state pathway is an accurate representation of the <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user experience</a> as it exist, refocus your stakeholders onto the future user experience. Step through the pathway and identify where changes need to be made.</p>

<p>As a group, compare the current to the future process and categorise the changes into people, process, policy/law and technology to start to articulate what needs to happen to deliver the future user experience. As you progress, capture any issues or risks that stakeholders identify and revisit afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="track-changes">Track changes</h2>

<p>As the design progresses revisit the documented future state user pathway to ensure the changes undertaken will deliver the desired outcome. If there are major differences or emerging issues, verify the future user pathway again with stakeholders to track the change and reconsider timeframes and resources to deliver the desired outcome.</p>

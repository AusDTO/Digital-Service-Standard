<h1 id="personas">Personas</h1>

<p>Exploring the experiences of common user groups</p>

<p>Personas represent a user group and summarise key characteristics of those users, including their values, beliefs and behaviours. They help you to understand a user’s experience with a service and how it may be impacted, both positively and negatively, by changes.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Personas help to focus design decisions by adding a layer of real-world consideration. They also offer a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritise features throughout the development process. A team can ask: “What would Bill do?”, “Would Shona like that?” or “How would Ivan use or interact with that?”</p>

<p>Personas can also help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stakeholders and leaders to evaluate new site feature ideas</li>
  <li>information architects to develop informed wireframes, interface behaviours and labelling</li>
  <li>designers to create the overall look and feel of the service</li>
  <li>developers to decide which approaches to take based on user behaviours</li>
  <li>content designers to ensure site content is written for the appropriate audiences.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-personas">Creating personas</h2>

<p>The purpose of using personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your client segments for reference. Personas are only as good as the research behind them, so they should be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualitative research</li>
  <li>some quantitative﻿﻿ <a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user_research.md">﻿﻿user research</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/web-analytics.html">web analytics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A ‘typical user’ persona is given a name, photo, likes and dislikes, habits, background, expectations, and any other information that will help the design team identify with the user.</p>

<p>For any given project, you generally only need to create 3 or 4 personas. The goal is not to represent all audiences or address all needs of the website but instead to focus on the major needs of the most important user groups.</p>

<h3 id="research-users">Research users</h3>

<p>Try to answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who are your users?</li>
  <li>why are they using the system?</li>
  <li>what are their behaviours, assumptions and expectations?</li>
</ul>

<p>Look for themes/characteristics that are specific, relevant and universal to the system and its users.</p>

<h3 id="organise-into-groups">Organise into groups</h3>

<p>Organise elements into persona groups that represent your target users. Name or classify each group. The groups should be representative of your groups and their driving behaviours. Sometimes these groupings may not be the ones you expected. For example, a single or small number of users may be actually a much more significant stakeholder than is acknowledged by many users. Rely on your research to form appropriate representative groups.</p>

<p>Combine and prioritise the rough personas. Separate them into primary, secondary, and, if necessary, complementary categories. You should have roughly 3-5 personas and their identified characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>

<p>Develop the appropriate descriptions of each persona’s background, motivations, and expectations. Do not include a lot of personal information.</p>

<p>Common persona information</p>

<ul>
  <li>Persona group (for example, web manager)</li>
  <li>Fictional name</li>
  <li>Job titles and major responsibilities</li>
  <li>Demographics such as age, education, ethnicity, and family status</li>
  <li>Goals and tasks they are trying to complete using the service</li>
  <li>Physical, social, and technological environment</li>
  <li>Quote that sums up what matters most to the persona</li>
  <li>Picture representing the user group</li>
</ul>

<p>Organise persona information in an easy-to-read and logical format.</p>

<p>Completed descriptions of the personas should be no more than one page. Consider enlisting the help of a user-centred designer in producing the personas.</p>

<p>Ensure the personas are placed in a visible central location where they can be seen by all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Once each persona is developed, consider developing <a href="../../node/scenarios.md">scenarios</a> then performing a walkthrough to influence your stakeholders to create better services. It’s important to note that personas are not a substitute for user testing.</p>

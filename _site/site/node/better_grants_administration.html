<h1 id="better-grants-administration">Better grants administration</h1>

<p>The 2015-16 Budget provides funding of $106.7m over four years to establish a simpler and more efficient whole-of-government grants administration process.</p>

<p>The work, to be managed across multiple agencies, will produce a standardised and scalable common grants management process across government, thereby replacing multiple existing systems and processes.</p>

<p>This will involve the development of two administrative hubs, once which will deal with grants for individuals or community organisations and one which will deal with businesses.</p>

<p>This will benefit individuals and businesses by quashing the need to navigate diverse systems and practices.</p>

<p>In addition, government grants’ applicants will no longer have to supply the same information multiple times.</p>

<p>This will save individuals and businesses time and money. It will also create a better user experience, allowing applicants to discover, register, and pre-qualify for grants that match their profile.</p>

<p>For government, it means no longer assessing grant applications in silos, resulting in better targeting of applicants and greater visibility of grants across government.</p>

<p>A data warehouse will also be established to give government greater ability to analyse grants’ data and to better manage and target grants funding.

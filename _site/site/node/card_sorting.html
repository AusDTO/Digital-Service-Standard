<h1 id="card-sorting">Card Sorting</h1>

<p>Understanding how users group information</p>

<p>Card sorting is an easy user research technique which helps you to develop structures based on how people naturally organise or think about different types of information.</p>

<p>Card sorting can help to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organise different items into logical groups</li>
  <li>determine a hierarchy of information</li>
  <li>identify items that are difficult to categorise</li>
  <li>identify terminology that is likely to be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-cards">Create cards</h2>

<p>Write the needs or topics to be categorised on up to around 50 individual cards. Be broad in your scoping of items to be categorised and remember to include items of different levels and detail. For example: ‘food’, ‘fruit’, ‘apple’ and ‘banana’ can all be cards included in the same card sort.</p>

<h2 id="select-group">Select group</h2>

<p>Select your participants and size of your session groups. You should aim for somewhere between 15 and 30 total participants.</p>

<p>The logistics of how the session will differ greatly depending on the size of groups. A one-on-one card sort can sometimes be intimidating for participants. Also, grouping similar users can deliver better results as you observe them working together: participants can challenge and validate each other’s thinking before making a decision.</p>

<p>Before testing with participants, do a dry run with a colleague to ensure the items make sense and the session flows smoothly (practice makes perfect).</p>

<h2 id="observe">Observe</h2>

<p>Before starting, ask the participant/s to verbalise their thinking and processes when they sort the cards. This will help you understand the reasoning behind their groups. Emphasise there are no right or wrong answers. We test the information, not the participant.</p>

<p>Give the participant/s the shuffled deck of cards and ask them to organise the cards into groups that make sense to them, including groups and sub-groups.</p>

<p>If you see there is a particular card users are having trouble placing or understanding, try to find out why. Ask open ended question to get an insight as to why it’s different to the others or why it doesn’t fit neatly.</p>

<h2 id="user-grouping">User grouping</h2>

<p>Once the sort is finished, give the participant some blank cards and ask them to give meaningful names to their groups using their own words. Once labelled, ask if there are any obvious sub-headings that could be added to the information to make smaller groups. This is only necessary if there is a particular structure of information or thinking you want to draw out of the participant/s.</p>

<p>Repeat this process with a range of participants until you can see some clear patterns of groupings and have gathered a range of insights from an aggregate of users.</p>

<h2 id="closed-sorting">Closed sorting</h2>

<p>Closed card sorting is a variation in which users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories. Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture of a website.</p>

<h2 id="online-tools">Online tools</h2>

<p>Card sorts can also be conducted online using tools such as <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort">OptimalSort</a>. This is a cheap and effective way of reaching a large sample of users without needing to bring them into a dedicated lab facility for the study.</p>

<h1 id="interviews">Interviews</h1>

<p>Connecting with people</p>

<p>Interviews are a way to connect with people and an opportunity to hear them describe their experiences in their own words. They can be used to find out what people want from a product or service. Interviews can also be a quick way to gather feedback or ideas about a <a href="prototyping.md">prototype</a> before getting too far into design and development.</p>

<p>An interview can be one on one or in a small group from a cross section of users or potential users with insight into the topic you’re exploring. They can be conducted in person, online or on the phone, depending on circumstances. Interviews can take anywhere from 1-2 hours depending on length and number of questions.</p>

<h2 id="write-an-interview-guide">Write an interview guide</h2>

<p>The interview guide acts like a checklist to help you prepare and follow a plan. It helps you to ensure the discussion is focussed and keeps on topic. It connects the research to the intent of the business problem you are solving. Begin with ‘What?’ and ‘How?’ questions and then go deeper by asking ‘Why?’. The interviewer(s) will use this to lead the conversation, prompt and engage with the participants.</p>

<h2 id="prepare">Prepare</h2>

<p>You need a way to capture information in a way that doesn’t distract your interviewees; who wouldn’t be distracted if they saw someone writing down every word they said? Not everyone has access to a room with a double-sided mirror but, with permission from the interviewee, you can use an audio or video recorder, or engage a more subtle note taker.</p>

<p>Before starting interviews practice with your team to make sure you have worded the questions so that they will gain a good response. This is especially important if several people will be conducting the interviews, to ensure consistent responses. Avoid a leading question like “Do you think it would be good if the product were green?” Better options would be “What colour do you think the product should be?” or “What colour would you associate with the product?”. Open questions allow interviewees to give more helpful answers, rather than just agreeing or disagreeing with the interviewer.</p>

<h2 id="professional-interviewers">Professional interviewers</h2>

<p>It’s quite easy for team members to conduct interviews but you should invest in a professional if you require fully evidenced results. A skilled facilitator will create an appropriate interview guide, won’t ask leading questions and will probe into the right areas. They will also be able to do the analysis work and draw on their experience to provide more insight.</p>

<h3 id="open-and-build-rapport">Open and build rapport</h3>

<p>Set the scene of what the interview is about and use warm-up questions, such as basic demographic points, to make the participant feel at ease. It’s important to be natural and let the conversation flow.</p>

<h3 id="broaden-and-gather">Broaden and gather</h3>

<p>Once the conversation is going, encourage the interviewee to think more broadly, and draw out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expectations</li>
  <li>things that inconvenience them</li>
  <li>reasons for doing things</li>
  <li>values and associated behaviours</li>
  <li>products and services they like</li>
  <li>barriers to doing things in a different way.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dig-deeper">Dig deeper</h3>

<p>Go further into interviewees’ responses by keeping on asking “What if?” in different ways. This is often how really great ideas are discovered.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-research">Using the research</h2>

<p>The best way to gain insights is to hold a debriefing session as soon as possible after the interviews. How you present your results depends on your specific needs, but generally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specify common themes or areas of conflict</li>
  <li>quantify data; for example, “20% of participants said that the system was difficult to us.” or “The word ‘concerned’ was mentioned 10 times during the session.”</li>
  <li>provide key observations and quotes</li>
  <li>identify relationships between like users and the answers they provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Services built on a shared core</p>

<p>Government as a platform means we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>influence core common platforms and channels across government to improve consistency and efficiency</li>
  <li>enable systems and data to have[](api.md)<a href="api.md">application programing interface</a> (API), where possible, to support flexible design of systems and, in many cases, public access and re-use</li>
  <li>present our individual portfolios and agendas as one government, supporting a whole-of-government user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>The Australian Government needs to continuously enhance service delivery that’s meaningful for our users. We also need to be the trusted source of information, acting as a central repository for open-government data that adds value to our users, including intermediaries.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i">How do I?</h2>

<p>The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will be providing guidance and support on government as a platform in the coming months to assist agencies in adopting this approach to service and information delivery. In the meantime, agencies are encouraged to continue publishing appropriate datasets on <a href="http://www.data.gov.au/">data.gov.au</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some useful reading on this concept is available:</p>

<h1 id="code-sharing">Code sharing</h1>

<p>Make source code open and reusable where appropriate</p>

<p>Sharing your source code and solutions and making them reusable encourages other agencies to do the same. Making source code available has other benefits too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduced cost and effort through re-using existing solutions</li>
  <li>reduced risk by accessing established, tried and tested resources</li>
  <li>increased collaboration through sharing resources, skills and knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>There are a number of polices that require Australian Government agencies to consider open source software in the procurement process and to contribute any changes they make back to the community, including the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/open-source-software/">Australian Government Open Source Software Policy</a>. Further explanation will be made available as this guide evolves.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i">How do I?</h2>

<p>Agencies will need to consider cross-agency and whole-of-government re-use, not just intra-agency re-use. They will also need to ensure they have the appropriate governance structures in place for any shared solutions. The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/files/2012/04/ICT_Customisation_and_Bespoke_Development_Policy.pdf">ICT Customisation and Bespoke Development Policy (PDF 26 KB)</a> provides governance principles for cross-agency solution sharing.</p>

<p>Agencies have the ability to publish, discover and consume common capabilities though <a href="https://www.govshare.gov.au/">GovShare</a>. GovShare is an online resource that allows government entities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish, discover and access a range of artefacts, such as policies, frameworks, standards and open source software used by Australian Government and state and territory entities</li>
  <li>explore ICT services used by Australian Government agencies</li>
  <li>contribute to online discussions using the forum. </li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing source code supports the development of government off the shelf (GOTS) solutions.</p>

<p>GOTS solutions are those developed by a national or international government agency, or a commercial entity at the agency’s direction, with the eventual implementation in more than one agency. The government agency that initiated the development shares the product with other agencies within a defined arrangement. For example, through a memorandum of understanding. GOTS solutions include solution components, interfaces, and modules (for example, hardware, software, technology, or computer products).</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s not possible to share software that was developed for the government by a third party because the third party retains ownership of the ‘intellectual property’ (IP) embodied in that software.</p>

<p>Agencies are encouraged to read the <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Pages/AustralianGovernmentIPrules.aspx">Australian Government intellectual property rules</a> for advice on how best to handle IP to support sharing source code.</p>

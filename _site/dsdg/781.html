<p>13/07/2015 - 5:07pm</p>

<p>Author: </p>

<p>Sharyn Clarkson</p>

<p>What does a great user experience actually look like? We started by
drawing upon all of our user research to create different options to
test with users.  We wanted to create experiences which were dynamic,
responsive, that cut across agencies and jurisdictions, and that enabled
third party reuse and innovation. </p>

<p>If we are going to achieve a better user experience we need to design a
future state that is consistent, user focussed and responsive to
changing needs, systems and structure.  We looked at how we can more
dynamically bring together information and services around the needs and
pathways of people, rather than the structures of government. </p>

<p>To move the discussion from the abstract, we built some conceptual
prototypes to test ideas. We picked some tangible scenarios that involve
multiple agencies or tiers of government, domestic and international
audiences, a variety of sectors and topics, services that require people
to login and transact securely, and from both business and individual
perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>

<p>We intentionally ignored the limitations of the existing technology
landscape in government because we want to design a future state that is
properly user-centric that agencies can align to. </p>

<p>We mapped the current user experience for a wide range of scenarios and
found a confusing number of options for users to choose from, often
with different or conflicting versions of similar information. We then
put our minds to how we could make this better, taking what we know from
existing user research and behaviours, whilst trying to overcome the
problems in the current user experience.</p>

<p>The conceptual prototypes demonstrate a potential future state for
engaging with government information and services, but also some
immediate options for improvement and the necessary dependencies for
future service providers. </p>

<p><strong>Show me the prototypes</strong></p>

<p>The prototypes are only conceptual - this is not a proposed visual
design.  They are designed to test possible ways for government websites
to work in the future, and are being shared for feedback.  We anticipate
that these will change over time in response to user testing.</p>

<p>The prototypes include options for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aggregating important information on entry points
like <a href="http://business.gov.au/">business.gov.au</a> and <a href="http://australia.gov.au/">australia.gov.au</a></li>
  <li>syndicating content to non-government websites</li>
  <li>exploring options around logging in and filtering information based
on user needs or behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can explore the prototypes via the <a href="http://ausdto.github.io/dto-proto/index.html">Information layer prototypes
index</a>, or watch videos of
the concept options in the following Youtube playlists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV2mhYZmTBFh48zvtreIHfmpW5LYr9tE0">Prototypes for “Losing your
job”</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV2mhYZmTBFj2bAXGRUmFxaasx6SmbnfI">Prototypes for “Expanding your
business”.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We identified that some of the functionality required to support this
future state would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discoverable and consumable content</li>
  <li>a whole of government services catalogue</li>
  <li>a trusted identity framework</li>
  <li>the whole of <a href="/blog/building-better-services-analytics">government
analytics</a> and <a href="/design-guides/guide/user-research">user
research</a>, </li>
  <li>the continued role of overarching websites like
<a href="http://australia.gov.au/">australia.gov.au</a>
and <a href="http://business.gov.au/">business.gov.au</a> to provide a
concierge service. </li>
</ul>

<p>As we get feedback on the prototype and it is tested and defined we’ll
map out the plan for how to transition to a future state. Once finalised
it will be added to the <a href="/design-guides">Digital Service Design
Guide</a> to support agencies in future planning.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>

<p>We are formally testing the prototypes with end users to see what works.
We want to hear your thoughts on the prototypes, the opportunities,
challenges and dependencies in trying to improve the user experience
with government as a whole.  Please share your thoughts here or though
the prototype pages on GitHub and YouTube.</p>

<p>We’ll also be holding a number of public consultations and consultative
events about the prototypes and other parts of the DTO’s work over the
next few months – so subscribe to the DTO mailing list or the RSS feed
to stay involved.</p>

<p>Hey Sharyn</p>

<p>Hi from the team over in NZ!</p>

<p>Great stuff that you’re sharing these prototypes early and publicly.
Really keen to see what the formal testing shows. If you need us to
share info about your consultations etc on this side of the ditch let us
know.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Sharyn, From what I can see on the videos so far - it looks really
good. Well done!!! No doubt, user testing will ensure that you (A) cover
ALL the options, and (B) that they ALL lead somewhere. I wasn’t sure if
‘Live Chat’ featured but I assume it does. Also, I recently became aware
of Engagement Tiles™ - a US product. They are modular interactive
content blocks you can embed into any website which can then convert
website engagement into email subscribers and potential customers with a
single click. They (or a similar tool) should make the response
experience very easy for our users! Cheers, John Macdonald, Assistant
Manager Victoria, AusIndustry – Business Services</p>

<p>Nice approach Sharyn,</p>

<p>Perhaps this might be of some use as the DTO begins it’s
whole-of-governments approach to User Centric Experiences.
<a href="http://paul4innovating.com/2015/07/05/the-three-horizons-providing-a-common-language-in-its-innovation-use/">http://paul4innovating.com/2015/07/05/the-three-horizons-providing-a-com…</a>\
 Each gov department is at different stages of this evolution. So we
need to ensure that we can talk about the short, medium and long term
approaches distinctly. If we separate the three, we can help charter the
changes from “sustaining”, to “disrupting”, to “transformative” stages
of innovation/user experience.</p>

<p>Stage One of user transformation. Many govs have introduced the
self-service approach to services that were once served up by a gov
employee. Usually they are found on a web site run by a National, State
of Local level of government. Now they are attempting to provide an
endless series of “life event” prototype services.\
 The idea of filtering information to make it more useful to a user is a
logical approach. But we discount communication/collaboration between
silos and the development/simplification of inter-related services. It
IS user design, but usually from the perspective of a user who must
understand which level of government handles what “non-personalized”
process/service.</p>

<p>At the same time we have had approaches, like govdex, whose aim it is to
encourage peer users, within and between, departments of various govs to
collaborate; or at least communicate and share their learning of their
silos approach to building services. This a cultural change, which can
only influence siloed cultures by illustrating an open culture. So all
the best.</p>

<p>Stage two - the federation of access and sharing of services/resources
by users from different institutions - is more easily seen by
investigating the .edu space. This video makes it plain.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPq0IvVGwhI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPq0IvVGwhI</a>
NB. Users can be either public employees or private citizens. The only
difference is the attributes allocated to their account(s).</p>

<p>This requires development of a trust fabric (common policies) framework,
as you say, so that users from different institutions can share rather
than duplicate resources. So maybe you’ll raise this element of
inter-network design to top priority. It affects all other elements.</p>

<p>Stage three - and were getting to the philosophic stage - where an
individual citizen, regardless of what institution they “come from” can
use the same user account in all government (including edu)
institutions, from Local through to International. There have been a few
discussions around the GDS traps about this transformation.
<a href="https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/26/identity-and-access-management-how-to-evolve/">https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/26/identity-and-access-…</a>\
 There is agreement that this holy (user centric) grail has little to do
with technology.
<a href="https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/24/identity-and-access-management/#comment-1141">https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/24/identity-and-access-…</a></p>

<p>Just one other matter, at this stage of your inquiry. We’re addressing
half the story with the DTO approach. i.e. The Information, excluding
the Consultation or Participation. I’ll point at this comment from the
Digital Democracy Commission’s group as it keeps things in context.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/8112256-6004992733595389954?trk=groups-post-b-title">https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/8112256-6004992733595389954?trk=groups…</a></p>

<p>Sorry if this one appears to be a promo for a piece of software. I’m
just making the point that engagement is going to require some media
people who can create some great (live) user experiences. e,g,
<a href="https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/01/delivering-live-events-digitally/">https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/01/delivering-live-events-digi…</a>\
 Thankfully I know the DTO team has some terrific talents hidden away.</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>As a Central Agency, Department of Finance is working on the Information
Management Program to better manage WoAG (Whole of Australian
Government) information in both Investment (Budget, Expenditure, New
Policy Proposals, Implementation &amp; Evaluation) and Resources (Land &amp;
Property, WoAG ICT, WoAG Travel, WoAG Procurement etc) domains which
includes extracting and sharing Business Insight from WoAG data.</p>

<p>Our focus is APS/WoAG and internal consumers and partners. As we
understand, DTO’s focus is ‘all information domains’, external consumers
and partners as well as internal (WoAG) partners. There are many
parallels in the Information Management Principles, Approach, Success
Criteria, Designs, and Technologies and so on.</p>

<p>The characteristics of approach we are considering are:</p>

<p>​1. Understanding and eliminating excuses for not going Digital - with
support from:\
 a. Electronic Transactions Act,\
 b. Assuring credibility of information provisioned and its management
through FOI, Privacy and Auditor General’s Act\
 c. Assuring security, reliability and availability of services\
 2. Gaining efficiency and productivity – minimising waste through
automated processes\
 3. Doing work for consumers - enhancing business insight including
providing raw data and reports/trends to consumers for improved
operational and strategic management, cost control and cost
appropriation (to cost drivers)\
 4. Building-in policy compliance characteristics – seamless compliance
- – consumer will automatically comply with certain policies and meet
legal requirements if they adopt digital pathways.</p>

<p>It is nice to build on each other’s ideas, test them internally (within
WoG – all three tiers) before we implement them externally.</p>

<p>The characteristics of approach we are considering are: (1)
understanding and eliminating excuses for not going Digital - with
support from (a) Electrinic Transactions Act, (b) assure credibility of
information provisioned and its management through FOI, Privacy and

<p>Great work! Glad to see these early hypothesis publicly shared. That’s
the only way to go.</p>

<p>As a designer, my instincts tell me scenario B is the way to go for the
next few years, until we can move to a fully integrated system like the
scenario A.</p>

<p>Scenario C (and even more scenario D) creates a lot of duplicated
content, as the agency’s website will most likely have similar
information next to the “apply” CTA. It creates a risk for outdated /
contradictory information and significantly slows down the flow for
users, who have to read a lot before finding the link to go to the
relevant agency’s site (in the example: DHS for newstart allowance).</p>

<p>But obviously… only proper user testing can tell for sure! :-)</p>

<p>Hi Sharyn,</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing! I wonder - when testing out the transition between a
central site and agency sites, will your prototypes capture the effect
of changing layouts? Something we’ve seen when testing on Govt.nz is
that the change in layout, colours, size of fonts when moving between
sites is very disruptive. I think that consistent interface design, even
if sites are branded differently, would go a long way to improve user
experience.</p>

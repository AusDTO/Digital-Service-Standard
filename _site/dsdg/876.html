<h1 id="creating-cultural-change-page-title-pagetitle-title">Creating cultural change {#page-title .page__title .title}</h1>

<p>Digital services and the technology on which they’re built should enable
change. This allows you the freedom to evolve your services according to
changing user needs, expectations and technology innovation.</p>

<h2 id="why-must-i-styleline-height-221520004272461px">Why must I? {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h2>

<p>Improving the way that you produce and procure digital services is more
about cultural and behavioural change than it is about IT. Technology
alone cannot improve public services.</p>

<p>To create digital services based on user needs, not on organisational
structures and processes, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/design-guides/guide/team">team</a> that is knowledgeable about
existing and emerging technology options</li>
  <li>a governance and management structure that is an enabler, not a
bottleneck or barrier to change</li>
  <li>flexible commercial models that meet your needs</li>
  <li>a diverse, competitive market from which to choose your suppliers or
products</li>
  <li>transparency and trust in your supplier relationships</li>
  <li>pricing competition and the ability to switch between alternative
suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="your-team-styleline-height-221520004272461px">Your team {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h4>

<p>To create better public services you’ll need to change existing
behaviours and cultures, and transition to new ways of working. You may
need to develop skills within your team and keep up-to-date on new
methods and technologies. It may sometimes be necessary to change your
physical working environment to get the best out of your team.</p>

<h4 id="governance-and-information-management-styleline-height-221520004272461px">Governance and information management {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h4>

<p>You may need to change governance and management structures to enable
you to run projects in a more flexible and agile way. You’ll also need
an effective approach to information management.</p>

<h4 id="new-suppliers-and-technology-styleline-height-221520004272461px">New suppliers and technology {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h4>

<p>You’ll need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have
found through new procurement routes, such as the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2014/09/23/cloud-services-panel/">Cloud services
panel</a>.</p>

<p>It may sometimes be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off
previous financial investments; you’ll need courage and conviction to
stop spending on old or legacy systems. The cost of maintaining
out-of-date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the
cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets user
needs.</p>

<p>If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the architecture and
hosting of your existing sites may need to be reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="break-down-barriers-to-change-styleline-height-221520004272461px">Break down barriers to change {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h3>

<p>You may come across disinterest or resistance when you try to make
necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided.</p>

<p>Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change. The more
successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more
entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be. Binding
suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their
business models and the way their business worked. They will be less
certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of
their market share and their exposure to open competition.</p>

<p>The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on
their current business model. That will reinforce their internal
resistance to change. It’s difficult for them to persuade shareholders
and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if outdated,
business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT
products as commodities. The IT as a utility market is not yet fully
established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model
might bring them higher profits on lower revenues.</p>

<p>You’ll also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff are
accustomed to old ways of working. It’s important that as a digital
leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update
their skills and experience. Some may be dependent on the advice of
external suppliers. Some may even have built their career on
accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies.</p>

<p>The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and
produced by those not burdened by past success; new market entrants and
those traditionally closed out from government work, like small or
medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p>You may find that you have become locked-in to a particular contract or
technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership
of a particular solution, you will have estimated the cost of exit at
the start of implementation. If you try to move and find that cost is a
barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated
with the binding supplier or system and not be considered as part of the
cost of a new solution.</p>

<p>Building on open standards or selecting products which use them will
help you to avoid this problem in the future.</p>

<h3 id="encourage-an-environment-that-supports-change-styleline-height-221520004272461px">Encourage an environment that supports change {style=”line-height: 22.1520004272461px;”}</h3>

<p>A flexible environment enables service managers to develop services and
make them responsive to user needs. It also avoids more risky big bang
changes.</p>

<p>Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and
support, or old and inefficient IT, means you can choose what best meets
the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost
and in a timescale that suits you.</p>

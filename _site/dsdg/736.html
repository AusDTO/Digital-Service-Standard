<p>Author: </p>

<p>The User Research Team</p>

<p>The first design principle of the <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/standard">Digital Service
Standard</a> is “users first”. To support
this we are working to better understand what users really need, expect,
prefer and actually experience when interacting with government.</p>

<p>There is no whole of government approach to understanding users. We are
going to change that. Today there is a mountain of agency specific
research but these results are often not shared and don’t take a whole
of government view. The DTO has been collecting this research, analysing
it and identifying key insights about user needs to share with the
people designing and delivering government services.</p>

<p>Some of the key insights that we’ve found so far include:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst people currently prefer digital channels and are using them,
they still want to be able to interact with a human if they need to,
but this doesn’t need to be face to face or via phone - they are
open to newer technologies such as web-chat and Skype.</li>
  <li>Whilst digital government services are getting better, experiences
still vary across agencies, services and channels, and there is much
room for improvement.  </li>
  <li>Finding information and services online is still particularly
painful for people.  </li>
  <li>Continual changes in policy and compliance requirements are
frustrating for businesses, which means they rely heavily on
intermediaries to help them manage this complexity.  </li>
  <li>Barriers to self service exist and these are often due to
infrastructure, cognitive barriers or attitudinal barriers.  ‘Status
Quo bias’, which is the tendency to stick to one’s current position,
can hold powerful sway over choices and behaviour.  This is
particularly true in the small business market who are time poor.</li>
  <li>Overall people are choosing to do more online.  According to ACMA,
the top 4 things people are doing online include using the internet
for research, email, general browsing and banking or paying bills.
 Accessing and using Government websites ranked in at ninth.</li>
  <li>Whilst people are doing more online, their expectations are being
set by the private sector. </li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.au.capgemini.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/Digital_Shopper_Relevancy__FULL_REPORT_.pdf">survey of online shoppers by
Capgemini</a>
showed people are looking for consistency and convergence amongst
different technologies and channels, and they have no pre-set views
about what belongs in which channel but will use whatever channel or
device is most relevant to them. </li>
  <li>Consistent with this, <a href="http://www.accenture.com/au-en/Pages/insight-trends-service-design-fjord.aspx">Accenture
concludes</a>
that as our digital experiences across devices becomes more
fragmented, there are four types of gaps that we need to address:
the gap when we lose bandwidth, when we move between devices, when
we’re handed over between different services, and when our data has
changed and needs to be updated.  </li>
  <li>There will always be people in the community who are unable or
unwilling to adopt digital services and expect traditional channels
or additional support.  Higher complexity interactions also warrant
human interaction. There are also user segments such as larger
business and intermediaries that expect a strong relationship with
the agency. </li>
  <li>Self service technologies are being increasingly adopted when they
are perceived to be useful, specifically: convenient, flexible and
functional.  However, if those technologies are not seen as easy to
use, they are unlikely to be adopted, irrespective of their
usefulness or potential benefits.  </li>
  <li>There is a lot of trust in government and the services it provides.
Along with this trust is an expectation that we will respect privacy
and keep information secure.  So government must effectively balance
these requirements with usability.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few preliminary insights but we will share more as we
continue our analysis.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think">What do you think?</h2>

<p>We would love your feedback! We will continue to provide our thinking
through blog links with the individual ideas and designs. We’ll be
holding a number of public consultations and consultative events over
the next few months – so subscribe to the DTO mailing list or the RSS
feed to stay involved.</p>

<p>Also, a question for agencies. What’s been your experience with user
research?  What does your agency need to efficiently and effectively
conduct user research? Get in touch if we aren’t already talking to you.</p>

<p>The government is not an online shop.</p>

<p>People literally rely on the government for their life, not just their
product. When you start keeping and controlling information in vested
databases, you create a portal for macro operations to injure it’s
citizens.</p>

<p>Security and amendments to digital protections written into the
constitution, and monitored by an independent committee will be the
first step for wide-spread public adoption of the “one-file” approach.</p>

<p>User self service is just pushing the task and responsibility on the
user and away from the people we pay to do the work. I dont like that
move.\
 Secondly to access digital one has to have web access. The user again
pays. The Government should make web access free across the country when
dealing with the authorities. Free access at the reduced number of
libraries with their ever decreasing opening hours is not the solution
and “free” wifi at shops is just not free.\
 Stop using PDF file format for Government documents. It is proprietary,
not “Free” do what the UK is doing using Open Document Format (ODF)</p>

<p>You make some great points Harry.</p>

<p>For those of us with ready access to Internet services and a high degree
of literacy and familiarity with Internet tools, it’s an easy trap to
fall into to assume that everyone is like us: services like Twitter
often create a sense of community that can be quite at odds with where
the nation is as a whole is. Given that government services need to be
accessible by all residents and citizens (both current and potential
future), it’s important to ensure these services are accessible by all
in the way that is both possible and ideally convenient.</p>

<p>So although I think the “digital service standard” is important to
support:\
 a) digital needs to be one channel, and not seen as the primary
channel, and\
 b) for a “users first” strategy to really work, it needs to operate
across channels, independently of digital channels, otherwise it
immediately fails to be a user-first strategy.</p>

<p>Note that the PDF format has been an open standard since July 2008, and
that there are open-source readers available. My personal view is that
it’s an OK standard for documents, and a much better option than
documents based on the proprietary Microsoft product formats (Word,
Excel, etc). It might be good for the government to offer links to
alternative PDF viewers and readers.</p>

<p>“User self service is just pushing the task and responsibility on the
user and away from the people we pay to do the work. “</p>

<p>How so? The current model requires the user to do just as much work,
they’re just filling out paper forms instead of digital versions. A
large portion of the work that government employees who interface with
the public are doing is grabbing the data from a form and then putting
it into a computer and then clicking the button that does the thing the
client wanted to do. Why can’t the client just do that themselves which
would then free up that employee to do something vastly more productive?</p>

<p>Right now centrelink offices include a few bays of PCs that can be used
if someone doesn’t have internet access at home. If someone still needs
help using a computer then there can still be a small amount of staff
available to help them or to enter the data for them.</p>

<p>The one time cost of moving to a digital solution is going to be a
significantly more efficient use of tax payers money than paying
customer service reps to do easily replaceable busy work until the end
of time.</p>

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Harry,</p>

<p>That’s a great comment (about “pushing responsibility onto the user”).
You also make the obvious point, that “Secondly to access digital one
has to have web access”. Bit impossible to even take responsibility if
you haven’t the tools to do so. This is such an important point as we
are (in the main) at the point where we want to use our own devices. The
idea of using an institutional device, while very useful, means that
we’d have to attend a physical .gov office (and then start learning how
to use an application)</p>

<p>You can see the frustration a gov employee (like Mathew?) has to put up
with in entering the same personal info into a departmental network’s
apps over an over again. We all share the common citizen’s complaint of
either, having to enter our personal info into a department’s
applications, or having some bored teller having to do it on our behalf.</p>

<p>Let me just point at the state silo’s approach to the second prob and
then point at how global unis have already solved it.\
 The state silo approach.\</p>

<p><a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/388820,adelaide-switches-on-free-outdoor-wi-fi.aspx">http://www.itnews.com.au/News/388820,adelaide-switches-on-free-outdoor-w…</a>\</p>

 <a href="http://www.vic.gov.au/wifi">http://www.vic.gov.au/wifi</a></p>

<p>You’ll find this approach is taken by most states, only in the large
population centres of course. The inevitable result of this “supply
orientated” approach?
<a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/388872,nsw-agencies-paying-too-much-for-telecommunications.aspx">http://www.itnews.com.au/News/388872,nsw-agencies-paying-too-much-for-te…</a></p>

<p>Now look at the same aim from a global universities perspective.
<a href="https://www.eduroam.org/">https://www.eduroam.org/</a>\
 I.e. If you come from a uni in one state, you can use your credentials
to access (your stuff at) any other participating uni’s network,
globally. In progressive, we’re already starting to see government’s
beginning to offer this service to their employees.
<a href="http://govroam.be/">http://govroam.be/</a>\
 There’s no reason, with the right networking approach and
(inter-institutional) ID, the same (demand orientated) approach couldn’t
be taken for/offered to all citizens. But that would entail that we see
individual govs agree on the same “trust network”.</p>

<p>The key to this comes down to giving all citizens an account, which is
not built around/issued by a few Federal agencies. i.e. We’ll see them
take an inter-institutional approach to IDA. Something like this.
<a href="http://www.ukfederation.org.uk/content/Documents/FedDocs">http://www.ukfederation.org.uk/content/Documents/FedDocs</a></p>

<p>Re: the “user self service” problem. At the heart of this approach is
making it dead easy for you, as a citizen to be in control of
issuing/changing your basic details (where do you live being the main
one) and informing all the other departments/governments at the same
time. That attempt has been tried, at a Federal level, for ages.
<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/canberra-kicks-off-tell-us-once-pilot/story-fn4htb9o-1226067685097">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/canberra-kicks-off-t…</a></p>

<p>It hasn’t worked (well) anywhere (in countries that don’t trust a
National government to issue a single ID) because it hasn’t taken a
user’s perspective.One good example is the UK’s approach to registering
to vote.
<a href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/10/under-the-hood-of-ier/">https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/10/under-the-hood-of-ier/</a>
All the service does is match your name &amp; National insurance number
(call it Medicare) with your Date of Birth (and probably address), which
is issue by Local Electoral Office. Now if they match, fine, and many UK
people have used this to register to vote. The GDS guys pat one another
on the back, while the Local Electoral Officers must laborious do the
‘change of address’ (for just this one service).</p>

<p>If a voter moves, then the National guys are quite useless. The change
is done, as is always the case, between two Local institutions (as can
be seen in Fig 3). Once that change is made, all the other National
institution’s address databases could/can be updated. So this service is
a great illustration of why a National mygov approach simply can’t work.
Utilities like this always require, especially if we want to “tell
US/THEM once”, a Local institution to provide the IDA.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lengthy reply. But there come a time where we need to put
the INDIVIDUAL citizen before an individual level of government
institutions.

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>Hi all, thanks for the comments. Firstly, this isn’t about pushing the
responsibility to citizens but rather, making it easier for citizens to
get what they need whilst also better supporting citizens who need
offline channels for service delivery. A lot of people actively want to
do their business with government online, but want a lot better online
services and information than they currently have access too. Which
includes better standards, less PDFs, more API enabled stuff for mashing
up government information and services, and generally bringing
government up to the user expectations of the 21st century. thanks all
for the comments, and keep them coming. More about some ways to tackle
these issues in the coming blog posts!</p>

<p>Cheers,\
 ​Pia</p>

<p>Agree, digital is about making it easier for citizens, but it absolutely
IS also about pushing responsibility onto citizens as well (or should
be). That’s exactly why compliance based organisations like Tax and
Human Services are involved. They have been moving (correctly) to self
service as self assessment and voluntary compliance for over 30 years,
digital is just a channel that can enable that more effectively.</p>

<p>Hi Pia,</p>

<p>Can I pick you up on this point - “this isn’t about pushing the
responsibility to citizens.” (It’s good a place to start as anywhere)\
 This IS about pushing the responsibility to citizens. It’s also about
enabling them to be more independent and providing them with the skills
and techniques to gain those government support services that they
possibly don’t know about - from three levels of public institutions (in
this country). So there is quite a lot of education which must happen -
not just in Aus, but between peers in different countries who work
inside different publicly-funded networks.</p>

<p>That said we seem to have a sticking point is Aus because, with
mygov.gov.au as it is now, we’ve come full circle; back to an online
version of the Australia Card. i.e. One point of authentication. E.g.
Even though we have Victoria coming on board (great!) we still haven’t
got past the old network concept that one (group of federal) agencies
will provide the user’s ID.

N.B. “While Victorian online services will be set up to accept myGov
credentials, myGov will not inversely accept native Victorian Government
user credentials”.</p>

<p>So, unlike the rest of the world, which is looking towards separating
the IDA from the replying parties (user orgs), we’ve built in a single
point of failure. That said, with mygov.gov.uk, we haven’t yet made
clear that which ID provider a citizen chooses will help to identify
which services are the ones they consider most important. i.e.
prioritize the services THEY require. N.B. “A trust framework is
developed by a community whose members have similar goals and
perspectives”.

<p>I’ll note this diagram, and web site’s library. It’s important because
it outlines the basic model that governments are borrowing from the edu
networks.

<p>It’s always been a problem. Once a citizen is employed by a particular
department, they throw away their citizen’s hat and start working from
an inside (a particular network’s) perspective. So “putting a User in
the centre of everything” becomes impossible. The challenge is usually
seen as “delivering gov services” and not “sharing a
<a href="http://publicservicesnetwork.service.gov.uk/">http://publicservicesnetwork.service.gov.uk/</a>
“ whose users must, in time, share space with other public service
network users in different countries.</p>

<p>That kind of development continues.

N.B “DSI’s”.</p>

<p>But so far as “Putting user in the centre of everything”, in Aus, like
in GOV.UK, we seem to get confused about the difference between User
organisations/Government institutions and the common citizens who must
use their services, because there is no choice to do otherwise.</p>

<p>Any reason why we can’t change the language and talk about “Putting the
citizen in the centre of everything”. It would certainly help in getting
a few public services out of the global research networks. FUBAR.

<p>Comment: </p>

<p>When I hear the topic of “digital services” come up in regards to
Australia it is usually prefaced by “limited access to”, I find that
there are several factors that contribute to this:</p>

<p>Restricted viewing outless and price gouging: If you want to watch the
latest shows from within Australia you’ll be hard pressed to find many
options, let alone options that let you watch them on-demand! At the
moment the biggest distributor is foxtel which is quite expensive for
the one or two series that you like.</p>

<p>Bandwidth restrictions: this one is fairly obvious, many services are
simply not available or have limited availability for Australians,
streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube and twitch TV are
practically unusable for many people, not just for viewers but for
content creators who are then restricted on how they can share their
product.</p>

<p>Other: on a side note I’m sorry but the Australian classification board
is -deleted-, they *should not* have the power to refuse
classification of media, digital or physical, by doing this they are
also a risk to the availability of digital content to Australians</p>

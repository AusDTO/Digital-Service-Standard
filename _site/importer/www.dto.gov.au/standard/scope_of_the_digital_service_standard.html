<h1 id="scope-of-the-digital-service-standard">Scope of the Digital Service Standard</h1>

<p>The <a href="digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard</a> (the Standard) applies to all existing and new Australian Government (federal) services that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../node/scope_of_the_digital_service_standard.md#_High_volume_Ttransaction">high volume transaction services</a> (for example, lodging a tax return online) </li>
  <li><a href="../node/scope_of_the_digital_service_standard.md#_Digital_information_services">digital information services</a> (for example, an agency website and its publications).</li>
</ul>

<p>These services must be the responsibility of, or partly owned and/or operated or funded by, a government department or agency (<a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/introduction/">PGPA Act non-Corporate entity</a>). The Standard does not apply to state/territory or local government services. However, these jurisdictions may elect to apply the Standard to service delivery.</p>

<h2 id="high-volume-transaction-services">High volume transaction services</h2>

<p>A digital service must meet the Standard before it can go live, if it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the responsibility of, or partly owned and/or operated or funded by, a government department or agency</li>
  <li>completely new and/or being redesigned</li>
  <li>processing (or likely to process) more than 50,000 transactions every year.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the service does not meet one or more of the criteria outlined above then it may not have to meet the Standard. For further clarity, <a href="../engage.md">contact us</a> for advice.</p>

<p>If the service is already operating, the agency responsible will need to provide a <a href="../node/digital_transformation_plan.md">Digital Transformation Plan</a>, by September 2015, on how it will adopt the Standard.</p>

<h2 id="digital-information-services">Digital information services</h2>

<p>All information that is the responsibility of, or is partly owned and/or funded by, an Australian Government department or agency is subject to the Digital Service Standard, including reports and other publications. If the information is completely new then, from June 2015, it must meet the Standard before it can go live.</p>

<p>Existing websites and publications will also need to be updated to follow the Standard. Australian Government agencies must provide a <a href="../node/digital_transformation_plan.md">Digital Transformation Plan</a> outlining how they will adopt the Standard for each of their information services by September 2015.</p>

<p>Personal ministerial websites (that contain material on a minister’s party political activities or views on issues not related to their ministerial role) are <strong>not </strong>included in the scope of the Standard.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-may-not-apply-to-everything">The Standard may not apply to everything</h2>

<p>Australian Government services cover a vast variety of activities including some highly specialised services with very few transactions. Applying the Standard to services dealing with only a handful of transactions may have little benefit. Similarly, legislative and/or technical barriers may prevent some services transitioning to the Standard, either in full or in part. These will need to be addressed over time. </p>

<p>Full or partial exemptions from the Standard may be appropriate in certain cases – <a href="../engage.md">contact us</a> for advice.</p>

Case studies
============

These case studies demonstrate how Australian Government agencies are following [the Digital Service Standard](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) and [better practice guidance](../foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) to improve services. They describe common obstacles and showcase some [common solutions](../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) agencies can use to deliver services without building their own.

We hope these case studies will support you in accessing existing knowledge and resources, creating cultural change in your agency, and sharing your own expertise. It's important we create an environment that helps agencies to be open, speak up and learn from each other, including sharing stories of failure as well as success.

If you'd like to contribute a case study [contact us](../feedback-design-guidance%3Furl_from=foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md).

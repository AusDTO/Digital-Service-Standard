Principles of digital service design
====================================

Guiding principles to design better services

The design principles provide the foundation for the Digital Service Standard’s [service design process](../node/foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md).

1. Users first
--------------

*Users generally interact with government out of necessity rather than choice. Put the needs of users first so they can access the information and services they need quickly and efficiently.*

Identify the people **who** will use the service, understand **what** they do,** how **they do it**, when** they do it and **why**.

2. Have a clear purpose
-----------------------

*Understand (really understand) the problem or outcome you are designing for.*

Articulate why a change is being made, before designing it. Be clear on the intent and what the driver is for change. Make sure everyone has the same understanding.

3. Keep it simple
-----------------

*Government is complicated, but interacting with it should be simple.*

Our backend systems need to be complex to achieve the sophistication necessary to deliver streamlined, easy-to-use information and services. But we need to do the hard work so users aren’t faced with this complexity.

4. Work together
----------------

*Working collaboratively and openly results in a better chance of generating ideas and problem solving than working alone.*

Involve government and industry to form multidisciplinary teams which have a diverse range of skills, expertise and experience. Bring in the right people at the right time throughout the design process.

5. Innovate and experiment
--------------------------

*Experimentation is critical to innovation.*

Challenge the status quo and take considered risks by exploring possibilities, testing concepts and asking questions.

6. Design end to end
--------------------

*Design for a holistic user experience, not a series of standalone products or services.*

One small change can significantly change a user’s experience with government. It’s not an improvement if it makes another service harder.

7. Use data to make decisions
-----------------------------

*Do the research and use evidence and analytics to inform your decisions.*

Don’t design based on assumptions. Use research and data to inform decisions and value this over opinions.

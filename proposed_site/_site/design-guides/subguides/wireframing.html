<h1 id="wireframing">Wireframing</h1>

<p>Low-fidelity visual representations of designs or concepts</p>

<p>Wireframes are two-dimensional representations of digital products, such as an app, website or software. Wireframes should be a low-fidelity illustration of what information will be communicated, where it will go, and the key interface elements. A good wireframe will provide a foundation for a high-fidelity <a href="../../node/prototyping.md">prototype</a>.</p>

<p>Creating wireframes will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visualise and test a product or concept without investing lots of resources</li>
  <li>connect content, information architecture and visual design</li>
  <li>test the intent with users and stakeholders</li>
  <li>guide your teams’ thinking</li>
  <li>facilitate quick and easy iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way forward, like most design tasks, is to start small and iterate the minimum viable product with users and stakeholders. Begin with some generic device screen sizes and aspect ratios of devices and work in a 1:1 scale whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>There are many ways to develop a wireframe. Choosing which tool, or combination of tools, depends on your desired outcomes, skill level and availability. Most wireframes will usually begin as a pen to paper sketch before developing into something more refined. If you continue with physical prototypes you can use graph and transparency papers, and post-it notes and cards to help you to position elements.        </p>

<p>Alternatively you can use software solutions like Microsoft PowerPoint, Visio, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, or specialized software solutions such as Axure and Balsamiq. Some software can be costly, but justified if complex interactivity is required.</p>

<h2 id="base-template">Base template</h2>

<p>A wireframe should be a map of what should go where. It should only reflect the elements that will be on every screen. It will form a platform to begin with each time you build a new screen. Usually the base layout will only include a header, footer and menu.</p>

<p>There should be three types of visual elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>categories of information: strictly headings, no content</li>
  <li>structure of information</li>
  <li>key user interface elements and <a href="../../node/common_website_elements.md">common web elements</a> (such as headers, footers and buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>The content categories should give an idea of the type of information a content block will contain. If you already have some basic content written it can be as simple as using the existing headings and sub-headings.</p>

<p>It’s important to keep in mind that these should only be placeholders without final graphic design. It can be tempting to insert logos and pictures, but these are merely distractions to the structure and layout.</p>

<h2 id="example-screens">Example screens</h2>

<p>Organise elements on the base template to build a few key screens that demonstrate the concept. Start small with 2-3 screens. This will usually consist of a home page, general content page and web form with text fields.</p>

<p>When designing and consulting with users, they may get caught on the lack of text. To counter this, use placeholder text such as <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> to give a more accurate visualisation of content in the blocks.</p>

<h2 id="test-and-improve">Test and improve</h2>

<p>Use a combination of <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user research</a> techniques to test the wireframes. When sharing with users ask them to verbalise their thinking out loud. Take notes of what they say and what is pointed out. Keep improving the screens in response. Test with users as many times as you need to develop a refined wireframe before you proceed to <a href="../../node/prototyping.md">prototyping</a>.</p>

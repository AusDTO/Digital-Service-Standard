<h1 id="user-stories">User stories</h1>

<p>Prioritising user needs</p>

<p>User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit. They’re a way of organising user requirements into manageable chunks that create tangible value, and can be discussed and prioritised independently.</p>

<p>We used user stories to develop the <a href="../../standard/digital_service_standard.md">alpha Digital Service Standard</a>.</p>

<p>A user story is a brief statement that explains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who the user of the service is (user)</li>
  <li>the task that they are completing (need)</li>
  <li>what they are trying to achieve (goal).</li>
</ul>

<p>A user story is represented through a story card that has a title and a few lines of text.</p>

<p>Stories can come from many places, but the most common sources are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Story writing workshops: usually at the start of a project, <a href="../../the_team.md">the team</a> will get together to develop <a href="../../node/personas.md">personas</a>, <a href="../../node/user_pathways.md">user pathways</a>, <a href="../../node/scenarios.md">scenarios</a> and <a href="../../node/user_stories.md">user stories</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="../../node/interviews.md">Interviews</a> with real users: ideally, you will set up a user panel which <a href="../../the_team.md">the team</a> have ongoing access to.</li>
  <li>User representatives in your <a href="../../the_team.md">team</a>: this may include the delivery manager or service / product owner.</li>
  <li>Observation: watching real users of your service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create">Create</h2>

<p>Your story cards can be virtual and actual. For a large service, keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning.</p>

<p>Story cards follow a standard structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title </li>
  <li>user</li>
  <li>narrative</li>
  <li>goal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bill Wake proposed the acronym <a href="http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/">‘INVEST’ as a summary of user story characteristics</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I - independent (fewer or no dependencies)</li>
  <li>N <strong>-</strong> negotiable</li>
  <li>V - valuable (provides business value to project owner)</li>
  <li>E - estimable</li>
  <li>S - small (and simple)</li>
  <li>T - testable (know how to tell that this story complete and successful).</li>
</ul>

<p>User stories aren’t intended to capture every detail; you should have a more in-depth discussion about a user story at the appropriate time. But it is important to make sure the user story is complete. Don’t skip the part explaining why there’s a need for a service just because it can be difficult.</p>

<p>You might want to include a list of acceptance criteria. These should be a reminder for things to test or check that may have come up during conversation, but they should not be used as a way of defining the scope of a story. If stories are too big then split them into smaller stories.</p>

<h2 id="prioritise">Prioritise</h2>

<p>When you have a series of user stories you can then prioritise them and make sure that they fit into the context of overall goals and objectives. This is where your team can determine what is needed from the users’ perspective to form a minimum viable product and what might fit into releases. You can rationalise what is needed with what is achievable.</p>

<p>Categorise your user stories based on their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>achievability for this release, or future releases</li>
  <li>importance to the user: are they a ‘nice to have’ or necessary?</li>
</ul>

<p>You should keep your user stories visible and accessible to the team to continually remind you about ‘what users want’. A good way to do this is via a physical Kanban or Scrum board in a high traffic area.</p>

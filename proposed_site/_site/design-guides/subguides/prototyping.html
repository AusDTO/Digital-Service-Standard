<p>Creating models to test user experience</p>

<p>A prototype is an initial model of a digital product or interface built to test the <a href="../../usability_testing.md">usability</a> and <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user experience</a> of a product. This includes testing information architecture, task flows, and look and feel. Prototypes simulate the visual, graphic, usability, content and navigational elements of the end digital solution or product.</p>

<p>Prototyping is an easy way to quickly test a digital product with users and stakeholders. They can vary in fidelity from very simple paper-based mockups to interactive online examples. This makes prototyping a more cost effective method than developing fully functional products to test, which encourages an iterative development cycle of building, testing and improving.</p>

<p>Other benefits of prototyping include the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reflect the look and feel of a finished product (colours, graphics, pictures and icons) without the cost</li>
  <li>inform requirements for the eventual build of the product</li>
  <li>serve as a platform to draw out and capture user behaviours, expectations and desired outcomes</li>
  <li>incorporate conditions of the computer or device, including interface and interactive elements (especially in high fidelity prototypes).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wireframe-or-prototype">Wireframe or prototype?</h2>

<p>The lines between a <a href="../../node/wireframing.md">wireframe</a> and a prototype are sometimes blurred but there are distinct differences. The primary purpose of a prototype should be to test the user experience and surface usability issues. A wireframe is a visual guide or screen blueprint that represents the framework of the service or product. Generally you would use prototypes to test specific aspect of a design; a wireframe will give you the ability to test broader concepts</p>

<p>General <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php">differences between wireframes and low and high fidelity prototypes</a> include:</p>

<h2 id="start-small">Start small</h2>

<p>Whether evolving a <a href="../../node/wireframing.md">wireframe</a> or starting a prototype from scratch, the key is to start small. Build a few key screens that demonstrate the <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user experience</a>, including key navigational elements. Good screens to start with include a home page, generic content item and a web form with text field.</p>

<h2 id="low-and-high-fidelity">Low and high fidelity</h2>

<p>Both low and high fidelity prototypes should have a level of resemblance to a final service. The line between a low fidelity and high fidelity will almost always differ from project to project.</p>

<p>A low-fidelity prototype will be visually unrefined, and only particular interactive elements are expected to work, if any at all. Low-fidelity prototypes are usually used to test broader usability, structural and architecture concepts with users. Don’t invest resources into making it look good! As long as the prototype demonstrates the user experience, and the level of visuals don’t impede the user, the prototype is fit for purpose. Sometimes users hesitate when a product looks finalised and difficult to change.</p>

<p>Caption: A user interacting with a low-fidelity paper prototype.</p>

<p>High-fidelity prototypes have the look and feel of a near completed product, including visuals (colour, graphics and icons). They also have comprehensive interactivity to navigate through the screens and content. High-fidelity prototypes can be used to test very specific usability and functionality, as well as visual look and feel.</p>

<h2 id="choose-platform">Choose platform</h2>

<p>It can be hard to choose a platform to build your prototype with the abundant number of tools available. Before jumping into building a prototype think about what your outcomes are. Also, consider whether you need low-fidelity, high-fidelity or the flexibility to move from one to another. Ultimately, platform choice may be made on the basis of skill level, resources and availability of tools.</p>

<p>Examples of low-fidelity platforms</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sketches</li>
  <li>Paper mock-ups</li>
  <li>Microsoft PowerPoint and Visio</li>
  <li>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of high-fidelity platforms</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Photoshop, illustrator and InDesign</li>
  <li>Axure</li>
  <li>Balsamiq</li>
  <li>Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="test-with-users">Test with users</h2>

<p>Test the prototype with users and capture insights. When showing them the prototypes ask them to verbalise their thinking and take notes of what they say and what elements they point at. Refer to <a href="../../node/user_research.md">user research</a> for types of testing you can conduct.</p>

<h2 id="iterate-prototype">Iterate prototype</h2>

<p>Iterate the prototype based on user feedback and repeat the process to progress the design. When your team, and your users are generally happy with the prototype - sometimes it will be a compromise - it’s time to move onto the build of your product.</p>

<p>Continue to share your prototypes with the development team to allow them to gather and build requirements and also understand the desired outcome.</p>

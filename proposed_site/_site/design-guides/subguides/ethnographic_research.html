<h1 id="ethnographic-research">Ethnographic research</h1>

<p>Observing users in real environments</p>

<p>Ethnographic research involves gathering real information on users’ everyday lives, activities, social relationships and surroundings.  </p>

<p>Ethnographic research is most valuable at the beginning of the design process. It helps you to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how people actually live, act and react</li>
  <li>what tasks or environments we might otherwise make assumptions on (to see the world through others’ eyes)</li>
  <li>differences between what people say and their actual behaviour</li>
  <li>constraints experienced by a particular audience in using a new product or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Common ethnographic techniques include contextual interviews, immersion, video diaries, photographs and observation. Instead of conducting observations in the artificial environment of a focus group or lab, ethnographic research can be carried out in a variety of environments, such as at home, at work, or during social interactions.</p>

<p>The amount of information collected can vary from several hours of observing and interviewing, to days, weeks or even months of observation.</p>

<h2 id="contextual-interviews">Contextual interviews</h2>

<p>To carry out a contextual interview you have the challenge of conducting an interview without making it feel like an interview. Instead, it should be a chat during which questions and answers are exchanged in both directions. You will need to plan ahead what tasks and questions you would like to observe.</p>

<p>Contextual interviews involve simply observing things users do naturally and asking questions along the way about how and why they are doing it. For example, you might sit with someone on their bus trip home and observe how they use an app on their phone, asking questions about why they did it that way and what was easy or hard, and so on.</p>

<p>Make sure you organise an analysis session within 24 hours of observation and interview sessions. If you can it is best to hold the analysis on the same day.</p>

<h2 id="recruiting-people">Recruiting people</h2>

<p>Depending on your project, anyone can participate in this type of research, but you need to make sure the participants will be suitable for your needs. It is also key that the right people conduct the research. Building trust with participants is very important.</p>

<p>You should fully explain the implications of the research when recruiting potential participants. Some may not feel comfortable with the levels of intrusion in their lives.</p>

<p>People can be studied on their own, with their family, friends or work colleagues. So, in addition to recruiting a participant, you may also need involve or recruit their family, friends and colleagues as part of the research. As this process is so personal, it is very important to explain what you will be doing and seek permission to use this information.</p>

<p>Helping users interact with government securely</p>

<p>Users of digital government services need to be able to sign in securely and conveniently to access services and records, and be confident that their data is secure and their privacy protected. Identity assurance is also the way that government can be confident that users are who they say they are.</p>

<p>A nationally recognised Trusted Digital Identity Framework (Framework) will establish a set of principles, technical architecture and interoperable standards for digital identities in Australia. Under this trust framework, users of digital government services will be able to assert their identities securely and safely, and relying parties can be confident that users are who they say they are.</p>

<p>The Framework will be developed in collaboration with the private sector. The objective is to give individuals and business users the choice of using accredited government and third-party identity provider information to access government services as part of a federated model. This will, in turn, generate trust in digital identities more broadly across the economy. It will also lead to improved access to services, new products and markets for consumers and industry, and more productive ways of doing business.</p>

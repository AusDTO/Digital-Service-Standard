<h1 id="assisted-digital">Assisted digital</h1>

<p>Assist users to interact and transact with government digitally, and provide alternatives for those who can’t.</p>

<p>A whole-of-government assisted digital strategy will ensure that assisted digital support is delivered consistently across government services and is a priority for all new and enhanced digital services.</p>

<p>All agencies with <a href="../../node/scope_of_the_digital_service_standard.md">services in scope</a> will need to outline their plan for providing digital assistance as part of their <a href="../../node/digital_transformation_plan.md">Digital Transformation Plan</a>.</p>

<p>As this guide evolves it will outline the circumstances in which a person may require assistance with digital interactions and the ways that this may be provided.</p>

These defined exceptions may be an inability to interact digitally due to location, disability, language, or digital literacy.</p>

<p>People who need help to interact digitally will be assisted to use digital channels. Those unable to will be provided with the support through appropriate channels such as shop-fronts, telephone, video or authorised representatives.</p>

<h3 id="identify-assisted-digital-users">Identify assisted digital users</h3>

<p>Assisted digital services will focus primarily on 3 key groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who will get there but require a little encouragement</li>
  <li>those who are almost there but need some assistance</li>
  <li>those who can’t get there and will need ongoing support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every service will have different mixes of assisted digital users. During the <a href="../../node/service_design_process.md#discoverdefine">Discover and Define phase</a> you need to develop an understanding of how many of your current non-digital users need assisted digital support and learn what their needs are.</p>

<h3 id="identify-assistance-required">Identify assistance required</h3>

<p>Assisted digital support can be delivered in many ways, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online, with access to appropriate support</li>
  <li>over the telephone, with someone guiding the user through the service or inputting information into a system on their behalf</li>
  <li>in person, at a service centre</li>
  <li>via video conferencing (from a shopfront or from the users’ location)</li>
  <li>through an authorised representative of the person assisting or acting on their behalf.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="make-sure-users-know-where-to-get-help">Make sure users know where to get help</h3>

<p>Ensure non-digital users can access the help they need to use the service.</p>

<p>This support is required to help non-digital users. However, it should not be heavily promoted beyond the target users as the intent is to encourage most people to interact digitally and independently. </p>

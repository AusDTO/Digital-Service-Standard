<p>Designing flexible and adaptable services through open standards</p>

<p>Agencies seeking to exchange data and information across their agency boundary must operate in a standardised environment or ‘alignment interface’. This means that there must be a coherent approach to the use of open standards and in some cases, standards agreed specifically for government use.</p>

<p>Government policy objectives in the 21<sup>st</sup> century require greater agility by agencies. This will increasingly require collaboration across portfolios and jurisdictions. Complex policy objectives related to water management, standard business reporting, national security, tax fraud for example, all require the participation of a wide range of agencies. In this context, it is important that agencies have a mechanism for agreeing on a standardised way of exchanging data to help achieve those business outcomes (for more information see the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/national-standards-framework/">Australian Government National Standards Framework</a>).</p>

<p>By implementing open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve adaptability and the ability for government to provide services based on user needs; avoiding digital exclusion based on the technology choices made</li>
  <li>put in place a level playing field for open source and proprietary software, giving government the ability to move between different technologies without the risk of lock-in</li>
  <li>make it easier to share appropriate data across and beyond government boundaries, providing efficient services for users and delivery partners</li>
  <li>make the cost of government’s digital services more sustainable by making things simpler and encouraging reuse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understand-open-standards">Understand open standards</h3>

<p>When designing cross-agency initiatives, agencies will need to identify open standards or agree upon government standards that are based on open standards. This will provide agencies with a design that enables digital services to be adaptable to change, providing you with better choice.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter whether you are designing and building in-house or outsourcing, your solutions need to comply with open standards for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>software interoperability</li>
  <li>data formats</li>
  <li>document formats.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 6 open standard principles to follow when thinking about, choosing and/or implementing which standards (open or government approved) to use.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User needs</strong>: this means placing the needs of your users at the centre of standards choices</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive</strong>: any supplier should be able to compete on a level playing field</li>
  <li><strong>Agile</strong>: support flexibility and change</li>
  <li><strong>Value</strong>: support sustainable cost and value for all stakeholders</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic focus</strong>: sufficient research and business analysis has been undertaken to enable an informed decision to be made</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: the processes for selecting, specifying and implementing the standard is both fair and transparent</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="select-the-right-standards">Select the right standards</h3>

<p>The Digital Transformation Office will identify some compulsory open standards which will be established through the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/national-standards-framework/">National Standards Framework</a> (NSF) process and explained in the Digital Service Design Guide. These standards will also be published on <a href="http://www.govshare.gov.au/">GovShare</a>.</p>

<p>Where you have a choice of which standard to adopt, do a thorough assessment of existing standards and other cross-agency initiatives. Choose one that meets your needs that is consistent with the <a href="../../standard/digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard requirements</a> and submit it through the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/national-standards-framework/">NSF process</a>.</p>

<p>Initial guidance on data exchange open standards is available in the <a href="https://www.govshare.gov.au/item-details/?rid=53589">Messaging Decision Support Tool</a> on GovShare. This work was approved for use by agencies by the Chief Information Officers Committee (CIOC) in December 2013.</p>

<p>In determining the suitability of the open standard, you should also consider how the open standard fits with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user and functional needs</li>
  <li>security and legal requirements</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/australian-government-architecture-aga/cross-agency-services-architecture-principles/">architectural requirements and principles</a></li>
  <li>economic efficiency of government as a whole</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/interoperability-frameworks/">interoperability</a></li>
  <li>preventing lock-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expressing your user needs as required capabilities, which are based on open standards, will help make better choices for service delivery. It also means that there is no unintentional lock-in built into government digital services.</p>

<h3 id="use-the-national-standards-framework">Use the National Standards Framework</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/national-standards-framework/">National Standards Framework</a> (NSF) deals with the need to agree on standards for cross-agency interaction.</p>

<p><img src="../../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png%3Fitok=wqHBFd4O" alt="Attention" title="Attention" /> T<em>he NSF <strong>does not</strong> deal with formal standards setting processes conducted by <a href="http://www.standards.org.au/">Standards Australia</a> nor does it impinge on sectoral standards governance procedures already in place (for example, health and education) and it does not identify standards for use. Standards that are set through a legislative mandate such as statistical standards through the Australian Bureau of Statistics are also not in scope. </em></p>

<p>The NSF provides an agreed mechanism that can deliver transparency, save considerable time, and provide a degree of certainty by agencies involved in collaborative projects. Agencies will have an authoritative process to follow with the potential to reuse work already completed in other projects. One of the problems identified in cross-agency interactions is the method, or protocol, through which agreement is reached on the standards to be applied in those interactions.</p>

<p>A foundation of the NSF is that agency and jurisdictional independence is respected. At the same time, it provides agencies and jurisdictions with a process to help ensure the timely completion of collaborative projects.</p>

<p>There are 4 key benefits for agencies using the NSF.</p>

<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>

<p>Each standard that is submitted for decision under the NSF is maintained by agencies working together. The decision-making process is consensus-based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard should be accessible to all interested agencies.</p>

<h4 id="transparency">Transparency</h4>

<p>The decision-making process must be transparent with the review being carried out by subject matter experts, and open to all interested agencies.</p>

<h4 id="due-process">Due process</h4>

<p>To guarantee quality, evaluation of the standard for government use is conducted by a working group. This is convened by a lead agency with a feedback and approval process.</p>

<h4 id="fair-access">Fair access</h4>

<p>The standard must be published, thoroughly documented, and publicly available.</p>

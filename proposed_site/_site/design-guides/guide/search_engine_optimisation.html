<p>Designing content to make it easier to find</p>

<p>Managing how your online content ranks in search engine results within your own website (onsite) and in external (offsite) search engines is known as search engine optimisation (SEO). This is relevant to anyone working with content development and publishing.</p>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>User experience is improved when content is easier to find. The actions required to make content easy to find are also aligned with better practice for <a href="../../node/online_writing.md">content development</a>, website publishing management and <a href="../../node/making_content_accessible.md">accessibility</a> work.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i">How do I?</h2>

<p>The best way to optimise content for users and search engines is to write useful, quality content using words users will use to search for your content (keywords).</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="identify-keywords">Identify keywords</h3>

<p>Learn which keywords users include when searching for your content. You can do this using several methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Search reports for specific words</strong></p>

    <p>Search appliances and web analytics reports can provide insight into what users are searching for on the web and within your website. Check with your <a href="../../the_team.md">Performance Analysts / Analytics Officer</a>. Google recently stopped releasing keywords so your reporting tool may not provide this information. However, you may be able to access your keywords if your department is participating in the whole-of-government analytics trial. Contact your <a href="../../node/digital_transformation_coordinators.md">Digital Transformation Coordinator</a> for details on how to participate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identify indicative words using</strong> <strong>Keyword Planner</strong></p>

    <p>The <a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/">AdWords Keyword Planner tool</a> provides great insight into which keywords are popular and relevant for your webpage. These keywords can become solid foundations for your content, providing value to your audience, and directing relevant traffic to the appropriate areas of your site. We recommend this tool for the insights and analytics it provides even if you are not using it for paid AdWords campaigns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Find general trends using</strong> <strong>Google Trends</strong></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> provides guidance in identifying and selecting keywords. It is a public web facility based on Google Search. It shows how often a particular search term is entered relative to the total search volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You should use these tools to develop a list of keywords and phrases that are relevant to your content and your target user group. There may also be other tools available for this purpose that are not included here.</p>

<p>You will need to review the monthly activity or popularity of these keywords to identify actual usage statistics. This should assist you in identifying the most effective keywords to use.</p>

<h3 id="optimise-content">Optimise content</h3>

<p>Once you have identified your most effective keywords and phrases, apply these to your content and your metadata.</p>

<p><img src="../../sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/importanticon.png%3Fitok=9UI4A82t" alt="Attention" title="Attention" /> While keywords in metadata will be ignored by Google they may still be important for other external search engines and for appliances that provide search on your website and intranet such as Funnelback and FAST.</p>

<p>In general, you should create content that suits online audiences (people scanning information top to bottom rather than reading left to right) and that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has a clear hierarchy</li>
  <li>is clear, accurate and information rich</li>
  <li>contains keywords naturally, strategically, consistently and in context.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write accurate, meaningful and unique titles</li>
  <li>use keywords prominently and appropriately in titles, text and metadata</li>
  <li>have a unique succinct description in the metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moz has a helpful introduction to <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">SEO and content optimisation</a>. <a href="http://www.accessiq.org/news/news/2014/04/google-seo-and-web-accessibility">Access iQ</a> and <a href="http://tosbourn.com/accessibility-seo-tightly-linked/">Toby Osbourn</a> have also written helpful guides on accessibility and content optimisation.</p>

<h4 id="titles">Titles</h4>

<p>Search engines only display the first 65 to 75 characters of a title in search results so it is important that early in your title you include the ‘what’ (the subject) and the ‘who’ (your audience) of  your content.</p>

<p>Also make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use keywords to make the title descriptive</li>
  <li>use keywords at least once and at the start of the title</li>
  <li>ensure pages have a unique title tag, which helps search engines know how the page is different from the others on your site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that a title can appear in many places, out of context, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>top bar of the browser</li>
  <li>heading at the top of the central content area</li>
  <li>top of the left-hand menu</li>
  <li>bread crumbs and human-readable URL</li>
  <li>search results as the blue hyperlinked text.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The description metadata field (also known as the descriptor, summary field or snippet) is used as a summary of the content. It is most commonly seen in search results under the blue hyperlinked title. Most search engines display approximately the first 160 characters (including spaces). Descriptions can also be used in RSS feeds and page summaries on websites where content is reused.</p>

<p>The description should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contain the main and unique points of the page; this assists the user in deciding which result to click on</li>
  <li>clearly cover the context – the ‘what’ (the subject) and the ‘who’ (your audience) – allowing an intelligent, non-expert to understand what the page is about and if it’s what they’re looking for</li>
  <li>include keywords close to the start of the description; this is better for users and search engines</li>
  <li>use full sentences whenever possible to facilitate usability and readability.</li>
</ul>

<p>On agency homepages the description should succinctly describe the key roles of the agency in active voice. For example, ‘Driving the digital transformation of government information and services, making them easier to find, use and consume’.</p>

<p><em>Title and description metadata fields and that page as it may appear in a search result.</em></p>

<h4 id="content">Content</h4>

<p>To better influence search results and improve the findability of your content, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create useful keyword-rich content based on what your online users are searching for</li>
  <li>ensure your most important content is in HTML so search engines can find it and index it</li>
  <li>use your keywords at least once, prominently near the top of the page</li>
  <li>take a considered approach to repeating your keywords throughout your content; only repeat where it makes sense and is in context (remember <a href="http://www.4syllables.com.au/2012/07/web-writing-versus-print/">writing online content is different from print content</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="language">Language</h4>

<p>Always use plain English and follow <a href="../../node/online_writing.md">online writing</a> principles. The following tips will also help you to improve findability of your content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the content is for a specific audience then ensure the description and first paragraph can be understood by an intelligent, non-expert.</li>
  <li>When writing content, consider the circumstances of why your audience would be looking for that content.</li>
  <li>Users who know a lot about the topic might use different keywords in their search queries from someone who is new to the topic. Anticipating these differences in search behaviour and accounting for them while writing your content (using a good mix of keyword phrases) could produce positive results.</li>
  <li>Text should be written in common terms that online users use to search. For example, more people search for ‘car’ or ‘cars’ than ‘motor vehicle expenses’.</li>
  <li>Be contextually consistent in terms for both online users and search engines. For example, if the page title is ‘shopfronts’ and the content is about ‘offices’ with no further mention of shopfronts, this is not contextually consistent.</li>
  <li>Most importantly, create content primarily for your users, not search engines.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="heading-levels">Heading levels</h4>

<p>Use headings in your content to provide structure as they guide both the reader and search engines. Remember:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headings must be sequential so mark up headings as H1, H2, H3</li>
  <li>titles are generally H1 and there should be only one H1 per page</li>
  <li>aim for a maximum of 4 levels</li>
  <li>use keywords at least once in the main headings of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="alt-attributes-image-alt-text">ALT attributes (image ALT text)</h4>

<p>Images must have text alternatives to describe the information or function an image represents. Where you need to include an image to support content you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use captions or make ALT attributes short, descriptive and meaningful. Explain to the user the essential aspects of what appears in the image. Don’t just repeat, in your ALT text, the image title or text that already exists in your content or caption.</li>
  <li>Create your ALT text to be the length of a tweet (140 characters). However, if the description needs to be longer because your user requires an explanation, it should be part of your content which refers to the image (and not included in your ALT text). Sometimes you will need to include a <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/">complex image</a> (for example, a chart or diagram); this may require you to link to a separate page with a detailed explanation.</li>
  <li>Use the keywords at least once in the ALT attribute for any relevant image on the page.</li>
  <li>Provide a null text alternative (alt=““) for <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/">decorative images</a> that have no value or relationship with the text; preferably incorporate these images through your CSS.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="traps">Traps</h4>

<p>You should avoid ‘keyword stuffing’ and ‘keyword cannibalism’ with your content as they will have a detrimental effect on the search engine optimisation of your webpage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keyword stuffing</strong> - the practice of filling a webpage with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate a site’s ranking in search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, or out of context (not as natural prose). Filling pages with keywords or numbers results in a negative user experience, and can harm your site’s ranking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keyword cannibalism</strong> - a situation where the government has multiple sites and pages that target the same keyword. When multiple sites and pages target a keyword, it creates confusion for search engines. More importantly, it creates confusion for users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage-whole-of-government-keywords">Manage whole-of-government keywords</h3>

<p>Currently there’s no whole-of-government approach to SEO, which is resulting in users being served inconsistent and confusing results from global search engines. Where work overlaps, this may result in government agencies competing against each other for result ranking and keyword use (keyword cannibalism).</p>

<p>The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will monitor keywords being used to search for government information. The DTO will work with agencies to ensure that the search results for those key words are the most appropriate. For example, the DTO will oversee and provide advice to agencies to ensure that for searches about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>life events or broad whole-of-government topics (such as, having a baby, studying, retiring) - entry point results appear the highest</li>
  <li>specific topic areas (such as taxation, health, education, importing) - the most relevant agency appears the highest</li>
  <li>specific programs or transactions (such as baby bonus, HECS/HELP, disability insurance) - the user is taken directly to the most relevant page about the program or transaction</li>
  <li>another level of government (for example, health, education, community services) - an entry point result is provided, otherwise the DTO will work with the jurisdictions to direct users appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agencies should assign responsibility for search management to a role within <a href="../../the_team.md">the team</a> (existing or new) and also provide the DTO with their contact details by emailing <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#110;&#097;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#105;&#099;&#115;&#064;&#100;&#116;&#111;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#097;&#117;">&#097;&#110;&#097;&#108;&#121;&#116;&#105;&#099;&#115;&#064;&#100;&#116;&#111;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#097;&#117;</a>.</p>

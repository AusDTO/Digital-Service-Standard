<h1 id="caretaker-conventions">Caretaker Conventions</h1>

<p>In the period preceding an election, the Australian Government assumes a caretaker role. The caretaker period begins at the time the House of Representatives is dissolved and continues until the election result is clear or, if there is a change of government, until the new government is appointed.</p>

<p>During the caretaker period there are specific requirements for the Australian Government, specified in the <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/publication/guidance-caretaker-conventions">Caretaker Conventions</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not to make major policy decisions</li>
  <li>to defer significant appointments</li>
  <li>to avoid entering major contracts</li>
  <li>to defer international negotiations or visits</li>
  <li>to avoid Australian Public Service involvement in election activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agencies are required to undertake additional steps when managing agency and ministerial websites during caretaker to ensure the management of these sites are consistent with the Caretaker Conventions.</p>

<p>Section 6. 2 of the <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/publication/guidance-caretaker-conventions">Guidance on Caretaker Conventions</a> covers internet and electronic communications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that agency funded websites are not used to support any particular political party</li>
  <li>existing materials that may be retained on websites and materials that may be added</li>
  <li>linking from websites</li>
  <li>maintenance of ministerial websites during caretaker periods.</li>
</ul>

<p>If further advice is required in relation to the caretaker period, departments and agencies should contact the Government Division, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on (02) 6271 5399.</p>

<p>How to measure and monitor digital services</p>

<p>It’s essential to measure and monitor how your service is performing, so you can make sure it continues to meet user needs in a cost-effective and efficient way. Use of simple metrics provides a way to identify the strengths and weaknesses of your service and will help your team to identify ways to improve your service over time.</p>

<h2 id="key-performance-indicators">Key performance indicators</h2>

<p>The <a href="../standard/digital_service_standard.md">Digital Service Standard</a> requires regular reporting of 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the ongoing performance of your service.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cost per transaction</strong> - the total estimated cost of your service per month (it varies for some services) divided by the number of completed transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital take-up</strong> - the percentage of your target take-up audience you have reached.</li>
  <li><strong>Completion rate</strong> - a percentage of completed transactions from started transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>User satisfaction</strong> - are users happy with the service you’ve provided? This will be determined from two sources: web metrics and user surveys.</li>
</ol>

<p>These aren’t the only things your service should measure. There are other unique indicators that will help you judge the effectiveness of your service.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="analytics_tools.md">Analytic tools</a> </strong>- choosing the right tools to measure your service.</li>
  <li><strong>Other performance indicators</strong> - other metrics your service might measure or track.</li>
  <li><strong>Using open data</strong> - how to make use of the performance information your service collects.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happens-to-your-data">What happens to your data</h2>

<p>Once live, the performance of your service will be displayed on a Digital Service Dashboard. This data will be presented in modules capable of being uniquely configured. These will be automated to update monthly and (where possible) will be visible to the public.</p>

<p>Guiding principles to design better services</p>

<p>The design principles provide the foundation for the Digital Service Standard’s <a href="service_design_process.md">service design process</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="users-first">Users first</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Users generally interact with government out of necessity rather than choice. Put the needs of users first so they can access the information and services they need quickly and efficiently.</em></p>

<p>Identify the people <strong>who</strong> will use the service, understand <strong>what</strong> they do,<strong> how </strong>they do it<strong>, when</strong> they do it and <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="have-a-clear-purpose">Have a clear purpose</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Understand (really understand) the problem or outcome you are designing for.</em></p>

<p>Articulate why a change is being made, before designing it. Be clear on the intent and what the driver is for change. Make sure everyone has the same understanding.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Government is complicated, but interacting with it should be simple.</em></p>

<p>Our backend systems need to be complex to achieve the sophistication necessary to deliver streamlined, easy-to-use information and services. But we need to do the hard work so users aren’t faced with this complexity.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="work-together">Work together</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Working collaboratively and openly results in a better chance of generating ideas and problem solving than working alone.</em></p>

<p>Involve government and industry to form multidisciplinary teams which have a diverse range of skills, expertise and experience. Bring in the right people at the right time throughout the design process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="innovate-and-experiment">Innovate and experiment</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Experimentation is critical to innovation.</em></p>

<p>Challenge the status quo and take considered risks by exploring possibilities, testing concepts and asking questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="design-end-to-end">Design end to end</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Design for a holistic user experience, not a series of standalone products or services.</em></p>

<p>One small change can significantly change a user’s experience with government. It’s not an improvement if it makes another service harder.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="use-data-to-make-decisions">Use data to make decisions</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Do the research and use evidence and analytics to inform your decisions.</em></p>

<p>Don’t design based on assumptions. Use research and data to inform decisions and value this over opinions.</p>

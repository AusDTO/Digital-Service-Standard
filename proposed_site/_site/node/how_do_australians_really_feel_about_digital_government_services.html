<h2 id="our-mission-is-to-put-people-first">Our mission is to put people first.</h2>

<p>We want to make government processes less complicated and less stressful for people; and as public servants, we have an ethical obligation to deliver the best quality service in the quickest possible time.</p>

<p>But do people actually want their services delivered digitally? How comfortable are they with technology? What do people expect when they interact with government? And do Australians have confidence in the government to deliver great services digitally?</p>

<p>We set out to take a snapshot of what Australians really think about government services, a ‘baseline’ measurement that will allow us to track community sentiment and perceptions over time.</p>

<p>We surveyed 1,200 individuals and 300 small businesses across the country to get the low-down.</p>

<p>The results aren’t surprising. In fact, it has confirmed what we’ve known for a while. But coupled with the measurement of user satisfaction at the services level, this should help us to build a long-term picture of how we’re progressing towards digital transformation.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-found">What we found</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The basics aren’t bad, but we’re not meeting the private sector bar</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people and businesses (77% and 78% respectively) agree they can do basic transactions with federal government via digital options. But only 60% of people and 67% of businesses agree they can successfully do all their interactions with digital options.  There’s still a long way to go, with only 7% describing digital services as a superior way to deal with government; and to confirm what we already know, more than 35% of people and 23% of businesses highlighted the gap that’s evident when government services are compared to those provided by the private sector.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s official: People want us to be online</li>
</ol>

<p>Data shows most people are comfortable with using digital channels to interact with federal government agencies, and more than a third said it was most preferred, or one of their preferred, channels. This ratio was even higher for small businesses, at 45%.</p>

<ol>
  <li>But are we ready for a primarily digital world? Not quite for everyone…</li>
</ol>

<p>The majority of those surveyed supported a model where most interactions with federal government were digital. Around 66% of individuals and 75% of small businesses were okay with the idea. Unsurprisingly however, the older you are, the more opposed you are likely to be this concept. The number of those who ‘prefer not to’ or ‘will not use’ digital channels to interact with government was as high as 54% in people aged over 65. People in remote or rural areas were also less likely to support a digital transformation of government services.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Used online government services before? You’re more likely to want more.</li>
</ol>

<p>We found a very strong link between those already using the government digital services available and those who were comfortable moving primarily to digital government.  In other words, people who already use services available are more likely to be comfortable interacting with government digitally in future.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do you think we can do it?</li>
</ol>

<p>While 74% of people are at least somewhat confident in their own ability to use digital channels, their faith in government to deliver information and services effectively through digital channels is lower. Just over 60% are confident the federal government can offer a safe and secure digital channel for transactions, but we have the confidence of just over half the population to meet all of their needs for information and transactions using mainly digital methods .</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>

<p>On the whole, the majority of individuals and small businesses are open and are positive towards moving to digital government services. But our opportunity for improvement is immense; there is a long road ahead to delivering excellent digital government services and building the community’s confidence in our ability to do so.</p>

<p>For those who are already comfortable with technology, we want to harness that, progress the digital transformation agenda and increase user satisfaction over time. But perhaps the most significant challenge for us is to effectively work with those people and businesses who are not currently using digital services and are wary of shifting to government digital services. For these members of the community, it’s important to remember that we’re not just about digitising government services. We’re focused on making the whole process of dealing with government better for you, whether you’re reaching us by phone, in person or online.</p>

<p>Great research. Keep it going and keep it coming please. Suggest that this be an annual survey</p>

<p>Under point 3: They looked at people in rural and remote - did they have figures for businesses in the same space?
 Recently a very contemporary regional and rural medical practice I was visiting showed me a fax from one of our departments that they recieved that day. I nearly fell out of the chair!</p>

<p>Then when I went to a local small business in the town I engaged with the owner who considered the old ‘fax’ machine as digital technology.
 There is plenty of challenghes both sides of the ‘fence’.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Nick, thanks for your feedback and comments.  We do plan on running a sub-set of the questions on a quarterly or six-monthly basis, and a more comprehensive survey annually to track changes.  In regards to rural and remote figures for small businesses, there was a hint that small businesses based outside of metropolitan areas were a little more dissatisfied – though the effect was not statistically significant due to small sample sizes.</p>

<p>With the less than satisfied approach to digital services from those in a rural / remote area - is it dissatisfaction towards the functionality of the service, or the unreliable internet needed to utilise the digital services? As the government pushes a digital agenda, it feels like the reliability on internet is considered less and less.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to compare the results with other countries, like UK, Denmark, or Germany.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, when comparing government services with other sectors, that there is a big difference in the user’s perspective here. When people engage with businesses online, they are usually doing it by choice because they want to buy something. When they engage with the government, it’s usually not by choice (even if they are applying for a benefit). That means their basic satisfaction is always lower. The best benchmark to compare government services against is other online versions of non-discretionary services like insurance companies, super funds and banks. I’d be interested to know how the survey questions were phrased.</p>

<p>Hi Jeremy, thanks for your suggestion.  We will consider for future iterations of the survey.  In terms of the phrasing of the survey questions, the questionnaires are included in the appendix of the report which you can download at the end of the blog post. </p>

<p>Hi there, given the population of Australia is approximately 23.6 million (<a href="http://countrymeters.info/en/Australia">http://countrymeters.info/en/Australia</a>) , a sample size of 1,200 individuals seems very in adequate to support the claims or trends you have published.</p>

<p>Does the DTO intend to increase its demographic selection to include at least 5% of the population to gain a greater understanding, also to break up the sample size in to Metro, Urban, Regional, Rural and Remote?</p>

<p>Perhaps the DTO should consider linking into the next National Census, in order to gauge a more accurate and diverse perspective on what the population thinks of Digital Government Services.</p>

<p>It would be only enhance the DTO’s claims and data sets however such limitations and constraints are understandable (caveats work well so that the data can be consumed accordingly).</p>

<p>Good work, it will be an interesting journey to watch.</p>

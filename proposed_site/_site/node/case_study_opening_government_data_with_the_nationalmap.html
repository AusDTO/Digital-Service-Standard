<p>Collaborating to visualise Australian Government data</p>

<p>The <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">NationalMap</a> is a browser-based visualisation and access tool for open government data. Together with <a href="http://data.gov.au/">data.gov.au</a> and <a href="http://find.ga.gov.au/">FIND</a> (the Australian Governments spatial data catalogue), it delivers on the Australian Government’s <a href="open_data.md">open data</a> agenda, and provides access to the Open Data Network.</p>

<p>The Open Data Network provides a ‘no wrong door’ approach to accessing openly available government data. This means users can enter the network at any node and reach the data they are looking for without needing to know who ‘owns’ that data.</p>

<p>The NationalMap encourages the publication of datasets that are most useful to end users: businesses, community organisations, researchers and other governments or government agencies. NationalMap allows users to innovate and achieve economic and social outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-did">What we did</h2>

<p>The Department of Communications (Communications) initially approached NICTA to develop a proof of concept and open source software using a user-centred design approach. Communications and NICTA began working with Geoscience Australia for the second stage of the process, to develop the NationalMap visualisation with geographical and scientific information.</p>

<p>The NationalMap requires raw data to be formatted in a particular way to be machine-readable and able to be uploaded online. As the NationalMap is the first of its kind for the Australian Government, some agencies are unfamiliar with these data formatting requirements. Communications is continuing to work with these agencies to help data to be shared in the right formats. NICTA has also produced a <a href="http://terria.io/DataProviders/csv-geo-au/">CSV standard</a> as a guide to provide consistent formatting.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h2>

<p>Some agencies are only becoming aware of the possibilities of the NationalMap as other agencies’ information is uploaded, and through the Communication’s ongoing social media strategy and work with all levels of government to provide advice on how to make their open datasets accessible and compatible with Australian and ISO data standards.</p>

<p>This means the process of releasing high value data to the economy is an iterative ongoing process. It requires a strategy of collaboration and communication with agencies to inform and ensure that data is accessible. Information will continue to be released as it is available, rather than as a single finished outcome.</p>

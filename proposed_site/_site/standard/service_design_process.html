<h1 id="service-design-process">Service design process</h1>

<p>Focussing on users’ experience to design and deliver better solutions</p>

<p>The service design process is an iterative and flexible approach which ensures users are involved in the design and development of new services.</p>

<p>The process consists of 3 phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="../node/service_design_process.md#discoverdefine">Discover and Define</a></li>
  <li><a href="../node/service_design_process.md#createiterate">Create and Iterate</a></li>
  <li><a href="../node/service_design_process.md#deliverevaluateimprove">Deliver, Evaluate and Improve</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can move between the phases at any time. Services that can no longer be improved should be considered for <a href="../node/service_design_process.md#retire">retirement</a>.</p>

<p>The phases are supported by <a href="../node/principles_of_digital_service_design.md">design principles</a> to ensure good design outcomes are achieved.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>Taking a design approach helps us to deliver useful and usable services based on evidence about what is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>desirable from a user perspective</li>
  <li>possible through technology and legislation</li>
  <li>viable from an Australian Government perspective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-do-i-do-in-each-phase">What do I do in each phase?</h2>

<h3 id="discover-and-define">1. Discover and Define</h3>

<p>Clarify the problem or opportunity for change, understand and come to an agreed view on the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are the users?</li>
  <li>What are the drivers for the change?</li>
  <li>What are the benefits for users and government?</li>
  <li>What is the desired outcome and the rationale behind it?</li>
  <li>Who is impacted by the change?</li>
  <li>What challenges exist that may impact the change?</li>
  <li>What behaviour is expected as a result of the change?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="undertakeuser-research"><em>Undertake user research </em></h4>

<p>Identify your users and get to know them. Analyse existing or undertake new <a href="../node/user_research.md">user research</a> to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>get valuable insight into users’ expectations of future government services, or their experience and thoughts on an existing service</li>
  <li>understand more about users’ overall experience with government, not just the service you are designing</li>
  <li>understand what proportion of your users will need <a href="../node/assisted_digital.md">assisted digital support</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="conduct-environmental-scan"><em>Conduct environmental scan</em></h4>

<p>Understand the context for the user and government including any possible impacts the change will have on existing services. Analyse policy and legislation to identify any barriers. This may require updating the policy to support the outcomes you want to achieve.</p>

<p>Review existing data, systems and content that may be able to be reused to support the delivery of the services.</p>

<p>This should provide you with a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing processes are in place for replacing or decommissioning services.</p>

<h4 id="form-the-team"><em>Form the team</em></h4>

<p>Identify and bring together stakeholders and core members to form <a href="../the_team.md">the team</a>.</p>

<h4 id="get-together"><em>Get together</em></h4>

<p>Run a series of <a href="../node/workshops.md">workshops</a> with the team. Start with an ABCD approach to drive a conversation and develop supporting documentation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where are we now?</li>
  <li>Where do we want to be?</li>
  <li>How will we get there?</li>
  <li>What will need to be done?</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h3 id="create-and-iterate">2. Create and Iterate</h3>

<p>Create and iterate an end-to-end solution that fits within the natural pathway of users</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research, design and test with users in an iterative way to ensure the service fits their needs</li>
  <li>Balance user needs with the government agenda when exploring options and designing services, taking into consideration their environment and constraints</li>
  <li>Concentrate on delivering services which make the <a href="../node/user_pathways.md">user journey</a> and experience as simple, clear and as fast as possible while maintaining integrity of the service</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="develop-options"><em>Develop options</em></h4>

<p>Develop options by using <a href="../node/user_research.md">user research</a> and involving a wide range of stakeholders from the private, industry and other parts of the public sector. Run a series of workshops with these stakeholders to develop your options.</p>

<p>When considering options, agree on what operational support and resourcing is needed to maintain the service or product post-production and who will provide it.</p>

<h4 id="test-early-and-test-often"><em>Test early and test often</em></h4>

<p>Create and share the emerging design and thinking as early as possible. Be willing to share your draft <a href="../node/wireframing.md">wireframes</a> or <a href="../node/prototyping.md">prototypes</a> with increasing detail and functionality (for example, low and high fidelity prototypes). Keep in mind people are less likely to provide feedback on something that looks finished. Early engagement and consultation will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grasp concepts quickly</li>
  <li>promote discussion and feedback</li>
  <li>progress the design in a collaborative way</li>
  <li>ensure transparency of the emerging design</li>
  <li>identify design issues early.</li>
</ul>

<p>The initial design shouldn’t be a fully developed solution but it should have enough information and detail, including real data where possible, to demonstrate its use. As you iterate you should be working towards prototypes that users can test in their ‘real’ environment (for example, in their workplace or on their preferred smartphone platform) but remember the overall goal is to make something quickly and test it early.</p>

<p>Run design walkthroughs. They are an effective visual way to show stakeholders the progress of the design. Walkthroughs help with early validation of design decisions, and are an efficient way to get feedback from several people at once.</p>

<p><em>An example of a design walkthrough: a team member uses a diagram across a long wall to demonstrate a user’s experience through the whole service.</em></p>

<h4 id="capture-and-document"><em>Capture and document</em></h4>

<p>Capture and document insights obtained from the user research activities you undertake in this phase. Document your designs throughout development including why certain decisions were made. Knowing why the service was designed that way will make it easier when making future improvements.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="deliver-evaluate-and-improve">3. Deliver, Evaluate and Improve</h3>

<p>Deliver the service according to feedback received during <a href="../usability_testing.md">usability testing</a>. As far as possible think about the future changing needs of users and aim to support scalability to accommodate changes.  </p>

<h4 id="go-live"><em>Go live</em></h4>

<p>Check the service meets the Australian Government requirements on <a href="../node/making_content_accessible.md">accessibility</a>, <a href="../node/branding.md">branding</a> and <a href="../node/common_website_elements.md">common website elements</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure your analytics are configured accurately to monitor the <a href="../node/measurement.md">key performance indicators</a> identified in building your service.</p>

<p>Make sure you have planned the transition or integration of any existing services.</p>

<p>Once the tested product meets all security, government and performance requirements it is ready to go live.</p>

<h4 id="monitor-the-service"><em>Monitor the service</em></h4>

<p>Gather and assess stakeholder and user feedback. Analyse dashboard results to identify issues that can be improved or problems that need to be fixed. When deciding how to address problems it is important to consider them in context.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why was the service created?</li>
  <li>What is the desired user experience?</li>
  <li>How does the service integrate with other government services?</li>
</ul>

<p>When evaluating the service it is important to identify if it is not meeting its intended purpose or is triggering unexpected consequences to other Australian Government services. You should also think of the opportunities for future improvements.</p>

<p>Monitoring of the service should allow sufficient time to cover usage periods and the range of user activities.</p>

<h4 id="influence-future-design-and-improvements"><em>Influence future design and improvements</em></h4>

<p>Services will continue to undergo evaluation and improvement; reacting to new needs and demands of the wider environment.</p>

<p>You may need to repeat the whole design process for smaller pieces of work as the service continues running. Find something that needs improvement; research solutions; iterate; and release. That should be a constant rhythm for the <a href="../the_team.md">operating team</a>, and done rapidly.</p>

  <li>User feedback</li>
  <li>Dashboard</li>
  <li><a href="../node/measurement.md">KPI assessment</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="retiring-a-service">Retiring a service</h2>

<p>When it is clear a service is no longer required, or those particular user needs are better met through a different service, it may be time to retire it.</p>

<p><img src="../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png%3Fitok=wqHBFd4O" alt="Attention" title="Attention" /><strong> Legislative requirements</strong>: there are <a href="../node/records_management.md">records management requirements</a> under the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796"><em>Archives Act 1983</em></a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/"><em>Evidence Act 1995</em></a> for Australian Government agencies.</p>

<p>In parallel to the work required to retire a services, and sometimes during the 3 phases, it will be necessary to archive content and records relating to the service. Whenever content is removed from a site you must consider the <a href="../node/records_management.md">records managing requirements</a> and appropriate archiving actions. ‘Archiving’, in this case meaning taking material out of active use and storing it elsewhere.</p>

<p>If there is an agency need to retain the material for an extended time, and it is not eligible for transfer to the National Archives of Australia, you will need to put in place preservation strategies to make sure the information being archived will remain accessible in the future, even after multiple changes to hardware and software.</p>

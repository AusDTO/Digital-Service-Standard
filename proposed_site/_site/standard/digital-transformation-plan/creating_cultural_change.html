<h1 id="creating-cultural-change">Creating cultural change</h1>

<p>Digital services and the technology on which they’re built should enable change. This allows you the freedom to evolve your services according to changing user needs, expectations and technology innovation.</p>

<h2 id="why-must-i">Why must I?</h2>

<p>Improving the way that you produce and procure digital services is more about cultural and behavioural change than it is about IT. Technology alone cannot improve public services.</p>

<h3 id="know-what-you-need">Know what you need</h3>

<p>To create digital services based on user needs, not on organisational structures and processes, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="../../the_team.md">team</a> that is knowledgeable about existing and emerging technology options</li>
  <li>a governance and management structure that is an enabler, not a bottleneck or barrier to change</li>
  <li>flexible commercial models that meet your needs</li>
  <li>a diverse, competitive market from which to choose your suppliers or products</li>
  <li>transparency and trust in your supplier relationships</li>
  <li>pricing competition and the ability to switch between alternative suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="know-what-you-may-need-to-change">Know what you may need to change</h3>

<h4 id="your-team">Your team</h4>

<p>To create better public services you’ll need to change existing behaviours and cultures, and transition to new ways of working. You may need to develop skills within your team and keep up-to-date on new methods and technologies. It may sometimes be necessary to change your physical working environment to get the best out of your team.</p>

<h4 id="governance-and-information-management">Governance and information management</h4>

<p>You may need to change governance and management structures to enable you to run projects in a more flexible and agile way. You’ll also need an effective approach to information management.</p>

<h4 id="new-suppliers-and-technology">New suppliers and technology</h4>

<p>You’ll need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have found through new procurement routes, such as the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2014/09/23/cloud-services-panel/">Cloud services panel</a>.</p>

<p>It may sometimes be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off previous financial investments; you’ll need courage and conviction to stop spending on old or legacy systems. The cost of maintaining out-of-date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets user needs.</p>

<p>If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the architecture and hosting of your existing sites may need to be reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="break-down-barriers-to-change">Break down barriers to change</h3>

<p>You may come across disinterest or resistance when you try to make necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided.</p>

<p>Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change. The more successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be. Binding suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their business models and the way their business worked. They will be less certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of their market share and their exposure to open competition.</p>

<p>The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on their current business model. That will reinforce their internal resistance to change. It’s difficult for them to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if outdated, business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT products as commodities. The IT as a utility market is not yet fully established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model might bring them higher profits on lower revenues.</p>

<p>You’ll also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff are accustomed to old ways of working. It’s important that as a digital leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update their skills and experience. Some may be dependent on the advice of external suppliers. Some may even have built their career on accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies.</p>

<p>The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and produced by those not burdened by past success; new market entrants and those traditionally closed out from government work, like small or medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p>You may find that you have become locked-in to a particular contract or technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership of a particular solution, you will have estimated the cost of exit at the start of implementation. If you try to move and find that cost is a barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated with the binding supplier or system and not be considered as part of the cost of a new solution.</p>

<p>Building on open standards or selecting products which use them will help you to avoid this problem in the future.</p>

<h3 id="encourage-an-environment-that-supports-change">Encourage an environment that supports change</h3>

<p>A flexible environment enables service managers to develop services and make them responsive to user needs. It also avoids more risky big bang changes.</p>

<p>Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and support, or old and inefficient IT, means you can choose what best meets the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost and in a timescale that suits you.</p>

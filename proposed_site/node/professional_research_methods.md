Professional research methods
=============================

More advanced user research techniques

Many [user research activities](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md) can be carried out by your team without a lot of prior experience or equipment. But when you need to find out something more specific or complex you may want to consider one or more of these professional techniques.

Each technique will be more relevant to one or more [service design phases](foi_act_and_information_publication_scheme.md#phases), but may be used in the others.

1. Discover and Define
----------------------

### Contextual enquiry

An interview undertaken with a user in the environment they complete the task. You watch them undertake an activity, understand the environment theyâ€™re operating in, see how they interact with the current service and gather information and artefacts. Artefacts can include paper cheat sheets, work-around spreadsheets and decision trees.

2. Create and Iterate
---------------------

### Desirability studies

Participants are offered different visual-design alternatives and are expected to associate each alternative with a set of attributes selected from a closed list. These studies can be both qualitative and quantitative.

### Eye tracking

An eye-tracking device is configured to precisely measure where participants look as they perform tasks or interact naturally with websites, applications, physical products, or environments.

### Usability lab studies

Participants are brought into a lab, one-on-one with a researcher, and given a set of scenarios that lead to tasks and usage of specific interest within a service.

### Moderated remote usability studies

Usability studies conducted remotely with the use of tools such as screen-sharing software and remote control capabilities.

### Un-moderated remote panel studies

A panel of trained participants who have video recording and data collection software installed on their own personal devices. Participants use a website or product while thinking aloud, having their experience recorded for immediate playback and analysis by the researcher.

### Un-moderated UX studies

A quantitative or qualitative automated method that uses a specialised research tool to capture participant behaviours (through software installed on participant computers or browsers) and attitudes (through embedded survey questions). This is usually done by giving participants goals or scenarios to accomplish with a site or prototype.

3. Deliver, Evaluate and Improve
--------------------------------

### A/B testing (multivariate testing, live testing or bucket testing)

A method of scientifically testing different designs on a site by randomly assigning groups of users to interact with each of the different designs. Then measuring the effect of these assignments on user behaviour.

### Clickstream analysis

Analysing the record of screens or pages that users click on and see, as they use a site or software product.

### True intent studies

A method that asks random site visitors what their goal or intention is upon entering the site. It then measures their subsequent behaviour, and asks whether they were successful in achieving their goal upon exiting the site.

Multiple phases
---------------

### Diary/camera studies

Participants are given a diary or camera to record and describe aspects of their lives that are relevant to a service or the target audience. Diary studies are typically longitudinal and can only be done for data that is easily recorded by participants. This can occur during any of the phases.

### Surveys

A detailed study of a group of people (population) to gather data on attitudes, perceptions and levels of satisfaction (typically used in Phases 1 and 3). Intercept surveys are triggered during the use of a site, application or service (typically used in Phase 3).

### User feedback

Open-ended and/or close-ended information provided by a user. This is often conducted through a voluntary feedback link, button, form, or email (typically used in Phases 1 and 3).

### Focus groups

A facilitated discussion with groups of 3-12 participants to gauge their reaction to a service, topic or idea (typically used in Phases 1 and 2). Focus groups can be used to:

-   understand how people feel and think about a program, service or issue
-   test an exploratory design as a preliminary study
-   gather requirements.

### Heuristic review

While not strictly user research, a heuristic review of a service is performed by usability experts to assess a design against established usability design principles and characteristics (typically used in Phases 2 and 3).

### Usability benchmarking

Tightly scripted usability studies are performed with several participants, using precise and predetermined measures of performance (typically used in Phases 2 and 3).

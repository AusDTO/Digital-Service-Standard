Comment: 

Hi, I am interested to see the nature of job roles being advertised for DTO, - helps to understand DTO will be hands on involved in development of digital services for the Australian community not just an overseeing role across federal departments. Is the model intended to be similar to Apple for example, where companies can develop 'Apps', but they must satisfy Apple's quality/security/UI standards, - and Apple put these through a stringent verification process prior to allowing new/changed Apps to be made available from their online store. In this situation are the DTO going to define the standards utilising feedback from user centred design, and develop services themselves where feasible to do so.
 Then will DTO also play a similar role to Apple, with government departments similar to companies building apps/services, - the departments have to verify for themselves first that they meet the minimum critieria to be made available through MyGov, and DTO do a verification process as a final check prior to allowing the new/amended service to be made available through MyGov, - to ensure quality, security, volume and UI standards are compliant. This would be a good way of ensuring high standards are maintained, and consistency in user experience across whole of government services.

I am very interested. I will bring WoG, eBusiness channels, innovative designs, ICT security and INformation Management skills and TQM/CI, programme and project management experience to DTO. I would like to see individuals who are 'visionary but be able to plan, design and deliver capabilities continuously in chunks' and practitioners of total quality management and continuous improvement TQM/CI engaged by the DTO.

Yes Yes it is. Unfortunately I don't reside in either Canberra or Sydney and I am unable to submit an application as the preference is only these 2 states. Please open it up to the rest of Australia!!

Hey Sam. If you're interested in working with us and you have the skills, experience and expertise we're looking for, I'd encourage you to apply. We don't have plans to open any additional offices at this stage, though. We're are open to flexible ways of working, and these will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

Is there a date when the application process closes, or does it just stay open until you have found the right people?

Hi there. These jobs will be advertised in the APS Gazette next week, and a closing date will be advised then and added to the position descriptions within a couple of days.

Comment: 

The Digital Transformation Office is a Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entity (NCE). NCEs subject to the Public Service Act 1999 or the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 MUST also advertise employment opportunities in the electronic APS Employment Gazette 3, incorporated on APSJOBS. Given that these jobs are not advertised on the APSJOBS, the DTO must not be subject to the APS ACT 1999. Is it the case ?

Response from our Corporate team. "Stay tuned! The DTO does indeed adhere to the APS Act and in line with that, we will be gazetting our vacancies shortly. If you 'd like the specific reference, check out the APS Commissioners Directions 2013 (Div 2 Section 2.9 (6)) :)"

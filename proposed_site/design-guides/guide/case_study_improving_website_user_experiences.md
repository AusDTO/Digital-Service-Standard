Case study: Improving website user experiences
==============================================

Using analytics to make services easier for users

The Department of Human Services (DHS) and CSIRO are improving the DHS website by looking at the order in which users visit DHS website pages and the time they spend on each page. They analyse this information to identify when and where a user is struggling to find what they need, and change the content and structure of the site to fix the problem.

What we did
-----------

CSIRO and DHS developed LATTE to help them understand how users interact with the DHS website, and where users struggle to find the information they need. LATTE analyses patterns in how users interact with the website. For example, the sequence of pages users click on and the amount of time spent on each page. Comparing patterns in website visits shows when and where users struggle to find what they need.

Lessons learnt
--------------

The patterns that LATTE identifies are helpful for web developers who are looking for common ‘pain points’ on the website. The developers can then change the structure of the site and the content on the pages based on LATTE’s findings. These changes make the website and its content better targeted to user needs and more user friendly because it is increasingly based on the indirect ‘feedback’ that users give about the website.

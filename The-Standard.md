Digital Service Standard
========================

The Digital Service Standard establishes the criteria that Australian
Government digital services must meet to ensure our services are
simpler, faster and easier to use. Meeting the criteria means we can
consistently provide high quality services and satisfy our users' needs.

All services within the [scope of the
Standard](http://www.dto.gov.au/standard/scope-digital-service-standard) must meet the
criteria before they can be launched. After launch, we will report
against our service performance.

This Standard is in beta stage. We encourage
your feedback on the
Standard to ensure it continues to deliver high quality outcomes.

The Standard is supported by [Design Guides](http://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides). The Guides
will help agencies design trusted and cost-effective government services
that are welcomed by users. In consultation with you - the service
practitioners in government - we will continue to develop the Guides
over the coming months, so stay tuned for updates.

You will notice we are speaking a new language; we are personalising our
content and making things clearer. We welcome your participation, so get
involved!

The Criteria
------------

Government agencies will be expected to:

1.  Understand user needs, conduct research to develop a deep knowledge
    of who the service users are and what that means for digital and
    assisted digital service design

2.  Establish a sustainable multi-disciplinary team that can design,
    build, operate and iterate the service, led by an experienced
    service manager with decision-making responsibility

3.  Design and build the product using the [service design and delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process), taking an agile and user-centred approach

4.  Understand the data, tools and systems required to build, host, operate and measure the service and how to adopt, adapt or procure them

5.  Assess what information and personal user data the service will be providing, using or storing. Put in place appropriate measures to address security risks, legal responsibilities and privacy considerations

6.  Measure user satisfaction, digital take-up, completion rate and cost per transaction and report performance publicly. Identify, measure and report other metrics appropriate to your service

7.  Incorporate open standards and common government solutions where appropriate

8.  Make all new source code open and reusable where appropriate

9.  Use responsive design methods and test that the service can be accessed on all common browsers and devices

10. Ensure the service is accessible to all users regardless of their abilities and environment

11. Show the end-to-end user experience in an environment that replicates the live version with a representative sample of users

12. Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels if needed, without repetition or confusion

13. Encourage users to choose the digital service and consolidate or phase out existing alternative channels where appropriate

14. Make sure that the service is simple enough that users succeed first time unaided

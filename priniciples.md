##Design Principles
 
Listed below are our design principles for all digital services. 

1.  Start with needs*

2.  Do less

3.  Design with data

4.  Work together
    Working collaboratively and openly results in a better chance of generating ideas and problem solving than working alone.

5.  Innovate and experiment
    Experimentation is critical to innovation. 

6.  Design end to end
    Design for a holistic user experience, not a series of standalone products or services. 

7.  Understand context 

8.  Build digital services, not websites 

9.  Be consistent, not uniform 

10. Make things open: it makes things better

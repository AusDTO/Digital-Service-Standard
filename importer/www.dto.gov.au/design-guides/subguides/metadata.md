Metadata
========

Ensure that resources hosted on agency websites use the mandatory minimum set of [AGLS metadata properties](http://www.agls.gov.au/documents/obligation/) for the Australian Government. The AGLS Metadata Standard was published as *Australian Standard (AS) 5044-2010* in 2010 and is endorsed by the National Archives of Australia for improving the visibility and availability of online resources.

The National Archives of Australia has [FAQ on applying AGLS in Australian Government departments](http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/create-capture-describe/describe/agls-faq.aspx) as well as online services to [validate existing metadata](http://www.agls.gov.au/validator) and [generate new metadata](http://www.agls.gov.au/generator).

Guidance on [website records management requirements](../../node/976.html) is also available.

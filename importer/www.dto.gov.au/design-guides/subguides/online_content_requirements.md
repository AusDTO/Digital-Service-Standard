Online content requirements
===========================

The Online Content Requirements are information items that Australian Government agencies must publish on their websites, including information that is required to be published as part of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS) under the [*Freedom of Information Act 1982*](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/) (*FOI Act*). The [IPS requirements relevant to websites](foi-act-and-information-publication-scheme/digital_service_standard.md#IPS) are discussed in a separate sub-guide.

The Online Content Requirements superseded the Online Information Service Obligations released in 2001. The Online Information Service Obligations were originally published as part of the 2000 Government Online Strategy.

Requirements for all Australian Government websites
---------------------------------------------------

### Identify the agency

Clearly identify the Australian Government agency or agencies responsible for managing the website on every page. Make sure you follow the [branding requirements](../../node/branding.md) and [refer correctly to the Australian Government](../../node/branding.md#refercorrectly).

### Provide contact details

Contact details for the responsible agency should be available from every page.

### Provide a website disclaimer

A disclaimer is a legal statement which asserts that the government agency issuing the disclaimer is not responsible for any mishap to which a user is exposed from applying whatever object or information the disclaimer is attached to. The disclaimer may refer to information on the website and/or linked websites. The disclaimer should be placed where a website visitor has a reasonable chance of seeing it.

The use of disclaimers does not excuse you of responsibility for maintaining accurate information on the website and keeping records of which information was displayed on the website and at what time.

There are no Australian Government templates for disclaimers. You should seek legal advice to develop an appropriate disclaimer.

Example of disclaimer wording:

*This material is general in nature. It is made available on the understanding that the Commonwealth is not thereby engaged in rendering professional advice.*

*Before relying on the material in any important matter, users should carefully evaluate its accuracy, currency, completeness and relevance for their purposes, and should obtain any appropriate professional advice relevant to their particular circumstances.*

*In some cases the material may incorporate or summarise views, guidelines or recommendations of third parties. Such material is assembled in good faith, but does not necessarily reflect the considered views of the Commonwealth, or indicate a commitment to a particular course of action.*

*Links to other websites are inserted for convenience and do not constitute endorsement of material at those sites, or any associated organisation, product or service.*

### Use uniform navigation

Uniform navigation is one of the essential elements of visual design for Australian Government websites.

Navigation is a component or a series of grouped components on a webpage that enable access to pages within a site. Components of navigation may include left-side, horizontal and vertical navigation, drop-downs, breadcrumb trails and in-page/inline hyperlinks. The arrangement of navigation has a strong relationship to the site’s information architecture.

Website navigation is both the presentation of the information architecture (the structure) of a website and the way users move around the site.

A variety of website navigation types are used throughout a website. The most common types include:

-   Global navigation that is consistent across the entire website and usually allows easy access to major parts of the site.
-   Local navigation that allows people to move around in the part of the website that they are currently in.
-   Contextual navigation that groups together related pages and is often embodied as links within text or lists of ‘see also’ links.
-   Supplemental navigation that comprises other additional navigation tools, such as site maps, indexes and guides.

When deciding on a navigation scheme it is important that users can:

-   determine what website they are on
-   tell where they are in the website
-   know where to go next.

It is helpful to provide a number of paths through a site to particular pieces of content, but it is necessary to ensure consistency in those paths.

In addition, agencies need to ensure the [accessibility](../../node/making_content_accessible.md) of the navigation scheme by:

-   using textual equivalents to supplement graphics for navigation elements
-   describing links accurately
-   ensuring it can be understood by [users from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds](../../node/inclusive_services.md#provide).

Additional requirements for primary websites of Australian Government agencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Publish details of individual grants

**![](../../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/importanticon.png%3Fitok=icqOt7eD)Legislative requirement**: The [Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines](http://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/grants/) (CGRGs) establish the overarching Commonwealth grants policy framework and articulate the expectations for all non-corporate Commonwealth entities in relation to grants administration.

Grant guidelines must be made publicly available (including on entity or whole-of-government websites). Exceptions are where there is a specific policy reason to not publicise the grant guidelines or grants are provided on a one-off or ad hoc basis.

Specific directions on publishing grants information are available in Section 5 of the [CGRG](http://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/grants/)s.

Effective disclosure and reporting arrangements for grants administration is essential for reasons of transparency and public accountability. Providing reliable and timely information on grants that are awarded is a vital for public and parliamentary confidence in the quality and integrity of grants administration.

### Make all forms digitally available

Agencies are required to provide printable or online versions of forms for public use. These should be interactive forms designed as part of an [accessible digital service offering](../../node/making_content_accessible.md), but in some cases might be downloadable forms for offline lodgement.

If it is not possible for a form to be made available online, information about alternative ways of obtaining and completing the form must be provided.

Online forms provide many benefits to the public:

-   Improved availability: forms can be accessed and submitted outside of business hours and do not have to be collected from a physical location.
-   Improved data capture and validation: problems can be reported in real time as the form is being completed.
-   Improved accessibility: digital forms can be read and completed by some people more easily than hardcopy forms, for example through browsers or screen readers.
-   Increased efficiency: streamlining the sequencing of questions tailored to the user also with the pre-filling of some information with certain online forms
-   Instant receipting or delivery confirmation: if the form is submitted online
-   Support end-to-end services: digital forms enable users to stay in the digital channel.

Online forms provide many benefits to agencies:

-   Reduced logistics effort and cost: there is no printing or physical distribution.
-   Version control: updated forms are instantly available and there is no outdated print stockpile.
-   Consistency in delivery: information can be provided alongside the form.
-   Reduced manual processing time and errors: data can be validated at input and automatically entered to backend systems.
-   Data can be integrated: such as by prefilling information
-   Reduced development, operational and support costs: by leveraging off existing whole-of-government service offerings (for example, ).

When determining the most appropriate online format for specific forms consider:

-   cost
-   complexity of the form
-   nature and size of the user group
-   authentication and security requirements.

Agencies also need to ensure the submission of online forms meets [security](../../node/secure_services.md), [accessibility](../../node/making_content_accessible.md) and [privacy requirements](../../node/privacy.md).

When designing a form, or building a business case, you should consider the context of your intended users, including:

-   IT aptitude: this may affect the amount of help text required in the form and other support arrangements.
-   Geography: this may affect options for submitting completed forms.
-   Bandwidth: some users may not be able to download large files or maintain online sessions (hence save and resume options can be useful).
-   Platform and application independence: some users may not have direct control over their IT environment, and this can be important if the form relies on particular applications or configuration settings.
-   Business goal of the form: is it a simple single-step interaction, or part of a complex series of steps? If the business process involves repeated reference to previous information, you may want to consider a web application.
-   Discoverability: how will the audience find out about the service or the form?
-   Consistency: consider linking other forms for related services, this may include forms from other agencies.
-   Different presentation methods: there are positives and negatives for all forms methods, including HTML DOCX, PDF and XSLT.
-   Business continuity: ensure you have another method or channel should the online form be unavailable.
-   ‘Wet ink’ signatures: the requirement for a wet ink signature may affect options for submitting completed forms. Depending on the form’s purpose, there may be other methods available for ‘confirmation of completeness’, approval and authentication.

When developing an online form, or converting an offline form to an online format, the following issues need to be resolved.

-   Distribution: how will users discover the form?
-   Data accuracy: what controls will be put in place to check for completeness or correctness before it is accepted? Potential answers could include cross-checking data in the form itself or against other online sources.
-   Online submission and receipting: if the online form is intended to reduce manual processing, automating the submission process, determining what information should be available immediately after a successful submission and linking it into backend business process are all ways to reduce double handling.
-   Automated data entry: make sure information is in a machine-readable format for insertion into backend business processes.
-   Associating completed forms with other items: does the form need to have online versions of payment or attachment processes as well?

### Publish media releases and speeches

Agencies are required to publish media releases and speeches and other public information such as public notices, warnings and advice. [Ministerial media releases](../../node/ministerial_content.md) should be published on the agency-funded minister’s site which should be linked from the agency site. A ministerial media release or speech is one that relates to the portfolio responsibility of the minister and should not contain material of a party political nature.

### Publish non-commercial agency publications

[Reports and other agency publications](foi-act-and-information-publication-scheme/digital_service_standard.md) must be made available on their website unless it is published under a commercial arrangement.

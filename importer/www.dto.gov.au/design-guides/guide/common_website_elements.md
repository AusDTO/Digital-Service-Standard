-   use appropriate [content licensing](../../node/1021.html)
-   provide a copyright notice
-   use open licensing where possible.

There are specific requirements for agencies about how to [refer correctly to the Australian Government in content](../../node/551.html#refercorrectly).

The primary websites of Australian Government agencies must also:

-   meet additional [Online Content Requirements](../../node/1001.html)
-   publish details of individual grants

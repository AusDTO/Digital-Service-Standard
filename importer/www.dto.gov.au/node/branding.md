Branding
========

Australian Government transactional and information services, including websites and print publications, must use common branding.

There are many benefits to common branding:

-   Strengthened identity and visibility of the Australian Government’s digital presence.
-   Certainty for citizens that they are using an Australian Government service or website.
-   Reduced complexity of Australian Government structure through a simple memorable identity.

Why must I?
-----------

Australian Government departments, agencies and other bodies' online and offline presence must comply with the [Australian Government Branding - Guidelines on the use of the Australian Government logo by Australian government departments and agencies](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/publication/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies) unless granted an exemption, or permission to use a co-branded logo from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister through the [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/contact-us).

How do I?
---------

-   [Download the correct template](branding.md#download)
-   [Present the Design correctly](branding.md#presentdesign)
-   [Refer correctly to the Australian Government in content](branding.md#refercorrectly)
-   [Check guidance on common uses](branding.md#checkguidance)

### Download the correct template

Follow the relevant links in the design columns to confirm you select the correct logo.

The files are provided in Adobe Photoshop 6.0/Adobe Image Ready 3.0 formats as zipped PSD files, with each element on its own layer, and all type and colour fully editable. The size, leading, tracking/kerning of the typeface and the dimensions between the primary elements of the Design should not be modified. Times New Roman is the only typeface font that can be used for all versions of the Design.

![Attention](../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png%3Fitok=wqHBFd4O "Attention") *The smallest version of the logos (32 pixels) must not be used on websites and may only be used when available space is limited (for example, mobile applications).*

#### Australian Government Design and Agency Design

The most important element of Australian Government branding is the **Australian Government Design** which is used where the Australian Government is required to be identified as a whole. The **Agency Design** is an extension of the Australian Government Design. It is for use in circumstances where an agency as a whole is to be identified.

Both Designs consist of:

-   the Commonwealth Coat of Arms (Conventional Version 3A Solid)
-   appropriate words with text set in Times New Roman Bold.

The Design can be configured as inline (horizontal) and stacked (with the Coat of Arms sitting above the centralised text) as illustrated in the [template table](branding.md#download).

#### Co-branding with an agency logo

Co-branding (the use of the Australian Government Design paired with a distinct agency logo) must have the prior approval of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Agencies with permission to co-brand should use either the inline or stacked versions of the Australian Government Design with the agency logo to the right, separated by a vertical line.

#### Multiple agencies

If a number of agencies need to be identified, for example on a collaborative website or joint sponsorship site, the department or agency names are to be presented in rows underneath each other, with all text set to Times New Roman Bold, each divided by an underline.

Alternatively, the Australian Government Design can be used to identify the Australian Government as a whole.

#### Agency functions, divisions and branches

The relevant Portfolio Secretary is responsible for how divisions, branches, offices and units may brand themselves. This branding must follow these rules:

-   Department or agency names should be Times New Roman Bold
-   the division or branch name appears directly underneath, with no underline, without bold.

#### An Australian Government Initiative Design and program branding

Program branding which includes a specific logo may be used in conjunction with the Australian Government Design, the Agency Design or the 'An Australian Government Initiative' Design.

[Back to top](branding.md#)

### Present the Design correctly

#### Position

The logo must have prominence over and above other images and graphic elements. This means that is other logos, text or images must not be placed above or to the left of the logo when applied to Australian Government websites or applications. The logo must appear either at the top of the left-hand side of every page (for example, in the case of websites) or the top-centre of the screen (for example, in the case of mobile applications).

Further guidance on [positioning the Design in specific contexts](branding.md#checkguidance) is available at the end of this section.

#### Design isolation zone

![An isolation zone shows a barrier around the Australian Government design.](../sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/isolation_guides.gif%3Fitok=Q00HuVxY)

#### 

Each file has a guide layer set, which should be repositioned to define the Design’s ‘isolation zone’ when purpose-specific text has been incorporated. The outer edge of the guide layer set defines the isolation zone.

An isolation zone has been established to ensure that the dignity of the Design is not jeopardised through crowding. The zone is based upon the distance between the top of the capital ‘A’ in ‘Australian Government’ and the bottom of the horizontal line beneath those words.

For Design size 32 the isolation zone is a 10 pixels wide border, for Design size 48, the isolation zone is 16 pixels wide and for the largest Design size 64, the isolation zone border is 21 pixels wide border around the Coat of Arms.

![Isolation zone for each available design size.](../sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/isolation_guide.gif%3Fitok=ykLRKjRK)

 

![Attention](../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png%3Fitok=wqHBFd4O "Attention")

* The overall dimension of an individual Design will vary, depending on the volume of text within each design – but the isolation zone remains constant. *

#### Colour use

The prime consideration in the use of colour is to maintain sufficient contrast to ensure the legibility of the Design. Attention and care are required to ensure the Design does not become 'lost through inappropriate use of colour or contrast.

#### Design treatment

The Design itself can be displayed using any solid colour. However, that colour must provide sufficient contrast to its background to ensure accessibility and general legibility. The accessibility requirements state a [minimum foreground/background contrast of 4.5:1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/Overview#visual-audio-contrast-contrast).

#### Background treatment

The treatment of the background in which the Design sits is crucial to its overall legibility. The background can be a solid colour, a pattern, a texture or a continuous image (photograph). Whatever the choice, the legibility of the Design must not be compromised through insufficient contrast.

##### Acceptable use of colour, contrast, texture and tone (example)

![Good Colour Use Examples](../sites/g/files/net466/f/styles/large/public/colourGood2.jpg%3Fitok=IOHGQkd0)

 

 

 

 

##### Unacceptable use of colour, contrast, texture and tone (example)

[Back to top](branding.md#)

 

#### Text Alternatives (alt text)

Alt text is an [accessibility feature](making_content_accessible.md) used to supply contextual information as an alternative to images. The alt text for the Design (when used only as an image) should read as follows.

**Usage**

**Correct alt text**

Australian Government Design

 

The Australian Government.

Department/Agency Design

 

The Australian Government Department of [full department/agency name].

Australian Government initiative program/product name

[Program name] followed by 'An Australian Government Initiative'.

![Attention](../sites/g/files/net261/f/styles/large/public/attention32.png%3Fitok=wqHBFd4O "Attention")

* Where the Design is used as a navigational element (for example, functioning as a link to the agency's home page) the alt text should alternatively describe the destination of the link:*

-   *if the Design is primarily for government and agency branding (most situations), then the alt text should be the agency name​*
-   *​​​if the Design is the only link to the agency's home page, then the alt text should be '[agency name] home'.​                                                                                                                                                                                                *

### Refer correctly to the Australian Government in content

Where the term ‘Commonwealth Government’ or ‘Federal Government’ was used, you should replace it with ‘Australian Government’. When discussing Australian Government agencies you should write the ‘Australian Government Department of XYZ’. Do not use the past reference the ‘Commonwealth Department of XYZ’.

The ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ is the legal entity established by the Constitution. It is sometimes referred to simply as ‘the Commonwealth’. You should only use ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ or ‘the Commonwealth’ to describe the entity established by the Constitution, such as in a legal context, or in a geographic sense.

There is more guidance on [preferred terminology](online_writing.md#usepreferred) available.

#### Amending old content

Content published prior to June 2003 should only be amended to reflect this guidance if it describes the agencies’ current functions or responsibilities, current programs and policies.

Do not change the following content for previous years:

-   annual reports
-   media releases
-   publications that have been tabled in Parliament
-   previous policy or program documents
-   financial statements
-   documents describing agencies legal entity or legislation
-   anything that alters the official record.

### Guidance on common uses

**Context**

**Guidance**

**Examples**

Agency websites

 

The Agency Design should appear at the top left of every page of an agency website. If desired, the Design can be used as a navigational element to link to the agency's homepage.

[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/)

Product/policy/program websites

 

Program branding which includes a specific logo may be located on sites in conjunction with an appropriately implemented version of the Design.

**The Australian Government Design**

Agencies have the option of using the Agency Design, the ‘An Australian Government Initiative’ Design or the Australian Government Design. Agencies should ensure consistency between digital and print products.

The chosen Design should appear at the top left of every page. If desired, the Design can be used as a navigational element to link to the home page.

**Program/product/policy logo or title**

The size and placement of the program/product/policy logo or title of the site should not compromise the hierarchy of the Design.

-   [Family Relationships Online](http://www.familyrelationships.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx)
-   [Commonwealth Budget](http://www.budget.gov.au/)

Ministerial websites

 

The [Australian Government Branding - Guidelines on the use of the Australian Government logo by Australian government departments and agencies](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/publication/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies) requires that there be a clear distinction between agency websites and ministerial websites. Ministerial sites should not include the Australian Government Design or the Agency Design; however the [Commonwealth Coat of Arms](http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/coat-arms/index.cfm) may be used.

[Minister for Finance](http://www.financeminister.gov.au/)

 

Mobile websites

 

The same principles of applying government branding should be followed wherever possible. That is, the appropriate logo should be applied to every page in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the logo.

Where it is not practical to apply the branding according to the instruction already outlined, the content should include the appropriate text alternative that is applied to the Design.

 

Mobile applications

 

The same principles of applying government branding should be followed wherever possible. That is, the appropriate logo should be applied to the landing or splash page in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the logo.

 

Intranets

 

The Agency Design should be applied to intranet sites. Placement is at the discretion of the agency; the top-left is recommended.

 

eNewsletters, digital versions of forms and digital brochures

 

Agencies should use the appropriate Design in a size that does not compromise the integrity of the Design. Where a plain text version of the email newsletter/alert is provided, the words 'Australian Government' should be incorporated in a prominent position.

On all forms, agencies should use the appropriate Design in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the Design.

 

Non-government websites

 

Agencies may find they have a need to be involved with cross-jurisdictional initiatives or websites outside the gov.au domain either through a sponsorship agreement or entering into a collaborative arrangement.

Appropriate branding needs to be considered. Agencies should negotiate to use the Design in the most appropriate place on the site that recognises the Australian Government's involvement, without compromising the intention of the initiative. This ensures a balanced recognition for the Australian Government and its partners.

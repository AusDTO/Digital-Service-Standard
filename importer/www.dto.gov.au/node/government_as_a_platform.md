Government as a platform
========================

Services built on a shared core

Government as a platform means we:

-   influence core common platforms and channels across government to improve consistency and efficiency
-   enable systems and data to have[](546.html)[application programing interface](546.html) (API), where possible, to support flexible design of systems and, in many cases, public access and re-use
-   present our individual portfolios and agendas as one government, supporting a whole-of-government user experience.

Why must I?
-----------

The Australian Government needs to continuously enhance service delivery that’s meaningful for our users. We also need to be the trusted source of information, acting as a central repository for open-government data that adds value to our users, including intermediaries.

How do I?
---------

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will be providing guidance and support on government as a platform in the coming months to assist agencies in adopting this approach to service and information delivery. In the meantime, agencies are encouraged to continue publishing appropriate datasets on [data.gov.au](http://www.data.gov.au/).

What does a great user experience actually look like? We started by drawing upon all of our user research to create different options to test with users.  We wanted to create experiences which were dynamic, responsive, that cut across agencies and jurisdictions, and that enabled third party reuse and innovation. 

If we are going to achieve a better user experience we need to design a future state that is consistent, user focussed and responsive to changing needs, systems and structure.  We looked at how we can more dynamically bring together information and services around the needs and pathways of people, rather than the structures of government. 

To move the discussion from the abstract, we built some conceptual prototypes to test ideas. We picked some tangible scenarios that involve multiple agencies or tiers of government, domestic and international audiences, a variety of sectors and topics, services that require people to login and transact securely, and from both business and individual perspectives.

**What we did**

We intentionally ignored the limitations of the existing technology landscape in government because we want to design a future state that is properly user-centric that agencies can align to. 

We mapped the current user experience for a wide range of scenarios and found a confusing number of options for users to choose from, often with different or conflicting versions of similar information. We then put our minds to how we could make this better, taking what we know from existing user research and behaviours, whilst trying to overcome the problems in the current user experience.

The conceptual prototypes demonstrate a potential future state for engaging with government information and services, but also some immediate options for improvement and the necessary dependencies for future service providers. 

**Show me the prototypes**

The prototypes are only conceptual - this is not a proposed visual design.  They are designed to test possible ways for government websites to work in the future, and are being shared for feedback.  We anticipate that these will change over time in response to user testing.

The prototypes include options for:

-   aggregating important information on entry points like [business.gov.au](http://business.gov.au/) and [australia.gov.au](http://australia.gov.au/)
-   syndicating content to non-government websites
-   exploring options around logging in and filtering information based on user needs or behaviour.

You can explore the prototypes via the [Information layer prototypes index](http://ausdto.github.io/dto-proto/index.html), or watch videos of the concept options in the following Youtube playlists:

-   [Prototypes for "Losing your job"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV2mhYZmTBFh48zvtreIHfmpW5LYr9tE0)

-   [Prototypes for "Expanding your business".](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV2mhYZmTBFj2bAXGRUmFxaasx6SmbnfI)

We identified that some of the functionality required to support this future state would include:

-   discoverable and consumable content
-   a whole of government services catalogue
-   a trusted identity framework
-   the whole of [government analytics](../news-media/blog/building-better-services-analytics.html) and [user research](481.html), 
-   the continued role of overarching websites like [australia.gov.au](http://australia.gov.au/) and [business.gov.au](http://business.gov.au/) to provide a concierge service. 

As we get feedback on the prototype and it is tested and defined we’ll map out the plan for how to transition to a future state. Once finalised it will be added to the [Digital Service Design Guide](../design-guides.html) to support agencies in future planning.

**What do you think?**

We are formally testing the prototypes with end users to see what works. We want to hear your thoughts on the prototypes, the opportunities, challenges and dependencies in trying to improve the user experience with government as a whole.  Please share your thoughts here or though the prototype pages on GitHub and YouTube.

We’ll also be holding a number of public consultations and consultative events about the prototypes and other parts of the DTO’s work over the next few months – so subscribe to the DTO mailing list or the RSS feed to stay involved.

Hey Sharyn

Hi from the team over in NZ!

Great stuff that you're sharing these prototypes early and publicly. Really keen to see what the formal testing shows. If you need us to share info about your consultations etc on this side of the ditch let us know.

Cheers

NW

Hi Sharyn, From what I can see on the videos so far - it looks really good. Well done!!! No doubt, user testing will ensure that you (A) cover ALL the options, and (B) that they ALL lead somewhere. I wasn't sure if 'Live Chat' featured but I assume it does. Also, I recently became aware of Engagement Tiles™ - a US product. They are modular interactive content blocks you can embed into any website which can then convert website engagement into email subscribers and potential customers with a single click. They (or a similar tool) should make the response experience very easy for our users! Cheers, John Macdonald, Assistant Manager Victoria, AusIndustry – Business Services

Nice approach Sharyn,

Perhaps this might be of some use as the DTO begins it's whole-of-governments approach to User Centric Experiences. [http://paul4innovating.com/2015/07/05/the-three-horizons-providing-a-com...](http://paul4innovating.com/2015/07/05/the-three-horizons-providing-a-common-language-in-its-innovation-use/)
 Each gov department is at different stages of this evolution. So we need to ensure that we can talk about the short, medium and long term approaches distinctly. If we separate the three, we can help charter the changes from "sustaining", to "disrupting", to "transformative" stages of innovation/user experience.

Stage One of user transformation. Many govs have introduced the self-service approach to services that were once served up by a gov employee. Usually they are found on a web site run by a National, State of Local level of government. Now they are attempting to provide an endless series of "life event" prototype services.
 The idea of filtering information to make it more useful to a user is a logical approach. But we discount communication/collaboration between silos and the development/simplification of inter-related services. It IS user design, but usually from the perspective of a user who must understand which level of government handles what "non-personalized" process/service.

At the same time we have had approaches, like govdex, whose aim it is to encourage peer users, within and between, departments of various govs to collaborate; or at least communicate and share their learning of their silos approach to building services. This a cultural change, which can only influence siloed cultures by illustrating an open culture. So all the best.

Stage two - the federation of access and sharing of services/resources by users from different institutions - is more easily seen by investigating the .edu space. This video makes it plain. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPq0IvVGwhI> NB. Users can be either public employees or private citizens. The only difference is the attributes allocated to their account(s).

This requires development of a trust fabric (common policies) framework, as you say, so that users from different institutions can share rather than duplicate resources. So maybe you'll raise this element of inter-network design to top priority. It affects all other elements.

Stage three - and were getting to the philosophic stage - where an individual citizen, regardless of what institution they "come from" can use the same user account in all government (including edu) institutions, from Local through to International. There have been a few discussions around the GDS traps about this transformation. [https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/26/identity-and-access-...](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/26/identity-and-access-management-how-to-evolve/)
 There is agreement that this holy (user centric) grail has little to do with technology. [https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/24/identity-and-access-...](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/24/identity-and-access-management/#comment-1141)

Just one other matter, at this stage of your inquiry. We're addressing half the story with the DTO approach. i.e. The Information, excluding the Consultation or Participation. I'll point at this comment from the Digital Democracy Commission's group as it keeps things in context. [https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/8112256-6004992733595389954?trk=groups...](https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/8112256-6004992733595389954?trk=groups-post-b-title)

Sorry if this one appears to be a promo for a piece of software. I'm just making the point that engagement is going to require some media people who can create some great (live) user experiences. e,g, [https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/01/delivering-live-events-digi...](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/01/delivering-live-events-digitally/)
 Thankfully I know the DTO team has some terrific talents hidden away.

Comment: 

As a Central Agency, Department of Finance is working on the Information Management Program to better manage WoAG (Whole of Australian Government) information in both Investment (Budget, Expenditure, New Policy Proposals, Implementation & Evaluation) and Resources (Land & Property, WoAG ICT, WoAG Travel, WoAG Procurement etc) domains which includes extracting and sharing Business Insight from WoAG data.

Our focus is APS/WoAG and internal consumers and partners. As we understand, DTO's focus is 'all information domains', external consumers and partners as well as internal (WoAG) partners. There are many parallels in the Information Management Principles, Approach, Success Criteria, Designs, and Technologies and so on.

The characteristics of approach we are considering are:

1. Understanding and eliminating excuses for not going Digital - with support from:
 a. Electronic Transactions Act,
 b. Assuring credibility of information provisioned and its management through FOI, Privacy and Auditor General's Act
 c. Assuring security, reliability and availability of services
 2. Gaining efficiency and productivity – minimising waste through automated processes
 3. Doing work for consumers - enhancing business insight including providing raw data and reports/trends to consumers for improved operational and strategic management, cost control and cost appropriation (to cost drivers)
 4. Building-in policy compliance characteristics – seamless compliance - – consumer will automatically comply with certain policies and meet legal requirements if they adopt digital pathways.

It is nice to build on each other’s ideas, test them internally (within WoG – all three tiers) before we implement them externally.

Great work! Glad to see these early hypothesis publicly shared. That's the only way to go.

As a designer, my instincts tell me scenario B is the way to go for the next few years, until we can move to a fully integrated system like the scenario A.

Scenario C (and even more scenario D) creates a lot of duplicated content, as the agency's website will most likely have similar information next to the "apply" CTA. It creates a risk for outdated / contradictory information and significantly slows down the flow for users, who have to read a lot before finding the link to go to the relevant agency's site (in the example: DHS for newstart allowance).

But obviously... only proper user testing can tell for sure! :-)

Hi Sharyn,

Thanks for sharing! I wonder - when testing out the transition between a central site and agency sites, will your prototypes capture the effect of changing layouts? Something we've seen when testing on Govt.nz is that the change in layout, colours, size of fonts when moving between sites is very disruptive. I think that consistent interface design, even if sites are branded differently, would go a long way to improve user experience.

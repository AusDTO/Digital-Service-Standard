The team
========

Establish teams with the right skills to create user-centred services that are digital by default

This guide outlines the different skills required in a sustainable multi-disciplinary team to design, build, operate and iterate a digital service that is in the [scope of the Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/digital-transition-plan/scope-digital-service-standard). The team should meet regularly, and work closely to deliver ongoing iterations of user-centred services. They should also have access to software tools and work in an environment that promotes collaboration and encourages fast decision making during developmental sprints.

The team will need to engage with the [Digital Transformation Coordinator](1061.html) within their agency when establishing or redesigning a digital service.

The roles and skills outlined are required regardless of whether the service is a website, a transactional service, or a mobile app.

Why must I?
-----------

Assembling a multi-disciplinary team is considered best practice for building digital services that are simple and intuitive enough to meet the needs of your users. It's central to the Standard.

How do I?
---------

There are a range of skills and capabilities that need to work together to successfully provide a digital service. The focus is likely to shift as a project moves through the different [design phases](971.html#phases). The core team is likely to remain fairly constant, but may need to draw in additional resources and expertise at different stages.

-   [Establish a team with appropriate roles](../team.html#establish)
-   [Consider outsourcing the requirements](../team.html#outsource)

### Identify the skills required

A digital delivery team needs the skills and capabilities to:

-   research and understand users and their needs
-   produce user stories and prioritise the identified needs
-   manage and report to stakeholders
-   manage dependencies with other teams
-   procure services or solutions from suppliers as appropriate
-   design, prototype and demonstrate digital service solutions
-   implement solutions for secure handling of data
-   test solutions with real users
-   deploy and host the website or service
-   support the live running of the service
-   iterate the service in response to user feedback and ongoing user research.

### Establish a team with appropriate roles

While there are no specific rules on the roles or team structure used to fulfil these capabilities, all of the following roles are essential to a project. You may use different names for each of these roles but the functions of the roles remain the same.

This list identifies key roles (in alphabetical order) defined as lead or technical and provides a description of the capability and skill required of each role. You will need to determine if these roles exist as part of your core team or are consultants you engage with on a casual or on-call basis.

Depending on the project and resources you have on hand, you may need to [outsource](../team.html#outsource) some of these roles.

All team members are expected to have an understanding of the [accessibility](456.html) and [assisted digital](361.html) needs for users of a service.

#### Leading roles

These roles involve managing or leading a project.

### Consider outsourcing the requirements

At times the skills and roles required won’t be available in an agency and it will be necessary to contract or outsource aspects of service development. 

Some agencies have established [ICT provision panels with multi-agency access clauses](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/portfolio-panel/portfolio-panels-table/), in accordance with the [Portfolio Panels for IT Services Policy](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/portfolio-panel/). While these may not address all the skills required of a multi-disciplinary team, they will address some of them.

You should contact your own agency procurement team first to explore opportunities to register with available panels. Using existing government panels will help streamline your procurement process.

Agencies are encouraged to list their ICT panels with multi-agency access provisions with the Australian Government Department of Finance at <ICTProcurement@finance.gov.au> The Department of Finance will then notify [AusTender](https://www.tenders.gov.au/) (where relevant) for publishing.

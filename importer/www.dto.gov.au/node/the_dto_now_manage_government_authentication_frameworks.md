The Digital Transformation Office is now responsible for a number of authentication frameworks which it inherited from the Department of Finance on 1 July 2015.
These frameworks include:-

-   The *National e-Authentication Framework*, which are a suite of better practice guides for implementing digital authentication systems;
-   The *Gatekeeper Public Key Infrastructure Framework*, which is a whole-of-government accreditation program for the use of public key technology by Government agencies; and
-   The *Third Party Identity Services Assurance Framework*, which is an accreditation framework for the use of commercially provided digital authentication services by Government agencies. These services include personal data vaults, digital mailboxes, data verification services and authentication services.

We’ll be adding these frameworks and status of accredited service providers to the DTO website over the coming weeks.  
If you’d like a copy of these documents or service provider status in the interim, please contact us at <authentication@dto.gov.au>

Thanks Drew,

Do you think, now you're in the dept of comms instead of finance, we could get into the habit of keeping the thread. So just a link to the archive would be useful from the italics above. i.e.

[http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/authentication-and-i...](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/authentication-and-identity-management/national-e-authentication-framework/)
 [http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/gatekeeper-public-ke...](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/gatekeeper-public-key-infrastructure/)
 [http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2013/09/24/third-party-identity-services-...](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2013/09/24/third-party-identity-services-assurance-framework/)

I appreciate that in Aus, it's considered that agencies only have other agencies (and potential service providers) as an audience. But eventually, as it says on the "third-party-identity-services" paper, "People will eventually be able to choose from a range of Providers in order to access the range of Government services they require". They can't do this, or choose some trustworthy public or private identity provider, when no gov agency takes the effort to educate citizens about how they can balance their privacy and security.

The title of this is very misleading. How about the DTO manage some (and by that we mean very few) authentication frameworks? I think you guys can do some real good (that's not all policy) but let's make sure we keep a lid on it until you do something awesome like say rewrite my.gov?

There is a need to demonstrate that such frameworks work. There are several Government and Private sector services that requires identity services (100 point id checks (i.e. CRIMTRAC forms, Opening a Bank account and many more). Are there projects to demonstrate that such partnerships and services are feasible and people can actually benefit from such frameworks? Is there a talk in this direction. MyGov is a good start, but apart from a single sign in facility, it does not go further.
 Is there a list of areas where the benefit of Digital Transformation will be visible tangibly to the ordinary citizen?

Thanks Ambarish,

That's the right approach, although going down the 100 points ID path tends to confuse the issue. We're talking about frameworks here, so let's include both the (A)uthentication (is this person who they say they are), and the A(uthorization) (does this person have the authority to access some service). AAI is THE terminology.

Top of our global examples here is the edugain framework <http://services.geant.net/edugain/About_eduGAIN/Pages/FAQs.aspx> where "a group of institutions and organisations that sign up to an agreed set of policies for exchanging information about users and resources to enable access to, and use of, the resources" is run across thousands of unis. N.B. This includes government-to-government.

We are talking here about a federation of federations. You may be interested in this project. <http://www.geant.net/MediaCentreEvents/news/Pages/Enabling_Users.aspx> (as one of many).

Perhaps the best approach here would be to ask the question "which department/institution will a citizen trust to inform all the others that they have changed address?" (Tell them ONCE).

This might help us get past this insanity that every level of a Nation's government will require to be told (in our case) thrice.

The biggest challenge with Authentication is how would systems know who you say you are?
 Lets looks at history.
 1. Secret Questions 2. Mobile Phones 3. Use of Avatars along with Passwords.
 Now if anyone saw the 60 Minutes Program that was aired on Channel 9 (see this link)

[http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/the-end-of-privacy-as-we-know-...](http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/the-end-of-privacy-as-we-know-it-60-minutes-uncovers-huge-mobile-phone-security-vulnerabilities/story-fn6vihic-1227485884359)

any electronic transaction done over smart devices especially using a mobile communication network can be cracked easily.

So now, how does one create an authentication infrastructure with people facing these vulnerabilities? The first start is a multi-layer secure platform approach. How does AAI address this issue?

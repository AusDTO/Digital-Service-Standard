About us
========

Every day, more Australians choose to interact with government on their mobiles, tablets and computers rather than face-to-face or over the phone.

That’s why the Digital Transformation Office (or DTO) has been created - to lead the government in transforming our services to improve your experience.

We’re working closely with individuals, businesses and industries as well as with Australian Government departments.

We’re identifying where improvements are most urgently needed, and re-designing these services from the ground up.

If you agree that dealing with the government should be (at least) as quick and easy as dealing with any other business, please [get in touch](contact-us.html) to see how you can work with us.

You can also keep up with us online though our [blog](news-media/blog.1.html), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ausdto) or [mailing list](http://govspace.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=18f172213d32ca205c7e524bd&id=172d06cc83).
